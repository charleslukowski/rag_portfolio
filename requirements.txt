# Dependencies - using versions from local build where potentially conflicting
numpy==2.2.5 # From local (watch for np.float_ error, may need <2.0)

PyYAML==6.0.2 # From local
referencing==0.36.2 # From local (jsonschema dep)

cryptography==44.0.3 # From local (various uses)

# Ensure these are present as they were explicitly added before for a reason
# and are in local reqs

# Packages to keep pruned if not strictly needed at runtime by app.py
# Consider re-adding if specific features fail and these are direct dependencies
# onnxruntime # If CrossEncoder needs it (was in local)
# tiktoken # If specific token counting is needed (was in local)

# Lower-level dependencies that are likely still needed by the above
# or by Streamlit itself, or for type checking support that Langchain uses.
