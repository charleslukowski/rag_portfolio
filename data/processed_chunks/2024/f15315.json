As required by IRC \nSection 432(b)(3)(B)(iii), the projected industry activity is based on information provided by the plan sponsor. The projections are based \non reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions and methods that (other than projected industry activity) offer my best estimate of \nanticipated experience under the plan.\nActuary’s signature\nDate\n1f.  Plan sponsor's address, city, state, ZIP code\nPage 2\nCatalog Number 35051D\nwww.irs.gov\nForm 15315 (Rev. 2-2024)\nInstructions for Form 15315, Annual Certification for Multiemployer Defined Benefit Plans\nPurpose of Form\nThe Form 15315, Annual Certification for Multiemployer Defined Benefit Plans, is used to report the actuarial certification of a \nmultiemployer plan’s status. The plan actuary must file this form annually with the IRS to satisfy the reporting requirements of IRC \nSection 432(b)(3).\nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), Pub. L. 109-280, added IRC Section 432 to the Internal Revenue Code. IRC Section 432(b) \ngenerally provides for a determination by the enrolled actuary for a multiemployer plan as to whether the plan is in endangered status or \nin critical status for a plan year. IRC Section 432(b)(3) requires the plan actuary to submit a certification each plan year to the Secretary \nof the Treasury and to the plan sponsor. The plan actuary must certify whether the plan is in endangered status for the plan year (or \nwould be in endangered status for the plan year but for the application of the special rule under IRC Section 432(b)(5)); whether the \nplan is or will be in critical status for the plan year or for any of the succeeding five plan years; and whether the plan is in critical and \ndeclining status for the plan year. The certification should include a statement as to whether the plan is making the scheduled progress \nin meeting the requirements of its funding improvement or rehabilitation plan. The actuarial projections, statements, and exhibits that \nare relevant to the determination of the plan status can be attached to this form.\nWho Must File Form\nThe enrolled actuary of a multiemployer plan must annually certify the plan’s status and file this form with the IRS.\nWhen to File\nThe Form 15315 must be filed no later than the 90th day after the beginning of the plan year for which the certification is made.\nNote. If the filing due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the Form 15315 may be filed on the next day that is not a \nSaturday, Sunday or legal holiday.\nWhere to File\nSubmit your certification once per year using only one of the following methods.\nMail the form to:\nDepartment of the Treasury \nInternal Revenue Service \nEmployee Plans \nCHI-7602 - 25th Floor \n230 S. Dearborn St. \nChicago, IL 60604\nFax the form to Employee Plans at 855-215-7122\nEmail the form to Employee Plans at EPCU@irs.gov with Multiemployer Certification in the subject line\nNote. More than one submission will result in duplicate entries. The IRS cannot guarantee security with email submissions.\nWho Must Sign\nThe plan's enrolled actuary must sign and date the Form 15315.\nPenalties\nAny failure of the plan actuary to certify the plan's status by the due date specified in IRC Section 432(b)(3)(A) will be treated for \npurposes of Section 502(c)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) as a failure or refusal by the plan \nadministrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under Section 101(b)(1) of the Act. A penalty of up to \n$1,100 per day applies.\nSee ERISA section 502(c)(2), 29 CFR 2560.502c-2, and the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by \nthe Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (2015 Inflation Adjustment Act). Pub. L. No. 114-74; 129 \nStat. 599 and the DOL's implementing regulation at 86 FR 2964 (Jan. 15, 2021). The 2015 Inflation Adjustment Act requires agencies \nto adjust the levels of civil monetary penalties with an initial catch-up adjustment, followed by annual adjustments for inflation. Because \nthe 2015 Inflation Adjustment Act requires the penalty amount to be adjusted annually, be sure to check DOL's website for any \npossible required inflation adjustments that may have been published in the Federal Register.\nSpecific Instructions",

See IRC Section 432(b) for determination of the plan’s status.\nA plan is in endangered status if the plan is not in critical status and is not described in IRC Section 432(b)(5) and, as of the beginning \nof the plan year, (1) the plan's funded percentage for the plan year is less than 80%, or (2) the plan has an accumulated funding \ndeficiency for the plan year or is projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency in any of the six succeeding plan years (taking \ninto account amortization extensions under IRC Section 431(d)). Under IRC Section 432(j), a plan's funded percentage is the \npercentage determined by dividing the value of the plan's assets by the accrued liability of the plan.\nIRC Section 432(b)(5) describes a plan that would be in endangered status for a plan year but for which the plan's actuary certifies that: \n(1) the plan is projected to not be in endangered status as of the end of the tenth plan year ending after the plan year to which the \ncertification relates; and (2) the plan was not in critical status or endangered status in the immediately preceding plan year.\nIn making the determinations and projections applicable under the endangered and critical status rules, the plan actuary must make \nprojections for the current and succeeding plan years of the current value of the assets of the plan and the present value of all liabilities \nto participants and beneficiaries under the plan for the current plan year as of the beginning of the year. The actuary's projections must \nbe based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions and methods that offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience \nunder the plan. Any projection of activity in the industry or industries covered by the plan, including future covered employment and \ncontribution levels, must be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, and the plan sponsor must act reasonably and in good \nfaith. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of the year must be based on either the most recent actuarial \nstatement required with respect to the most recently filed annual report or the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.\nA plan is in seriously endangered status if the plan is in endangered status and, as of the beginning of the plan year, (1) the plan's \nfunded percentage for such plan year is less than 80% and (2) the endangered plan has an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan \nyear or is projected to have such an accumulated funding deficiency for any of the six succeeding plan years (taking into account any \nextension of amortization periods under IRC Section 431(d)).\nA plan is in critical status for a plan year if it meets any of four specified tests under IRC Section 432(b)(2)(A), (B), (C), and (D). A plan \nis in critical status for a plan year due to receipt of special financial assistance under IRC Section 432(b)(7) if the plan has received \nspecial financial assistance under section 4262 of ERISA in the plan year or an earlier plan year. A plan is in critical status due to the \nspecial rule related to benefit suspensions in IRC Section 432(e)(9)(J) if a suspension of benefits under IRC Section 432(e)(9) applies \nto the plan and the plan has not emerged from critical status. IRC Section 432(e)(9)(J) provides that a plan to which a suspension of \nbenefits under IRC Section 432(e)(9) applies may not emerge from critical status under IRC Section 432(e)(4)(B) until (1) the plan is no \nlonger certified to be in critical or endangered status, and (2) the plan is projected to avoid insolvency under IRC Section 418E. A plan \nis in critical status due to failure to meet requirements for emergence under IRC Section 432(e)(4)(B) if the plan was in critical status \nduring the prior plan year and the criteria set forth in IRC Section 432(e)(4)(B) for emergence from critical status have not been met.\nThe plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan that is not in critical status and is not described in IRC Section 432(b)(5) for a plan year but \nthat is projected by the plan actuary to be in critical status in any of the succeeding five plan years may, not later than 30 days after the \ndate of the certification, make an election under IRC Section 432(b)(4) for the plan to be in critical status effective for the current plan \nyear. The plan year in which the plan sponsor elects to be in critical status will be treated as the first year in which the plan is in critical \nstatus, regardless of the plan year for which the plan first satisfies the criteria for critical status, and a plan that is in critical status under \nthis paragraph will not emerge from critical status except in accordance with IRC Section 432(e)(4)(B).\nA plan is in critical and declining status for a plan year if the plan is described in IRC section 432(b)(2)(A), (B), (C), or (D) for the plan \nyear and the plan is projected to become insolvent within the meaning of IRC Section 418E during the current plan year or any of the 14 \nsucceeding plan years (19 succeeding plan years if the plan has a ratio of inactive participants to active participants that exceeds 2 to 1 \nor if the funded percentage of the plan is less than 80%).\nPage 4\nCatalog Number 35051D\nwww.irs.gov\nForm 15315 (Rev. 2-2024)",
