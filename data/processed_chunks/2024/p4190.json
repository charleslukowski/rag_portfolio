    "text": "WHAT DIFFERENCES ARE THERE IN REPORTING MY RETIREMENT INCOME \nAND MY INCOME (EARNED) DURING MY WORK CAREER?\nWhen you received your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement prior to retirement, you reported your wages on an \nindividual income tax return, such as Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. You also may have received \nself-employment income on Form 1099-NEC, Nonemployee Compensation, if you were a contractor/subcontractor \nor if you performed independent projects or services. You reported your income by attaching a Schedule C, Profit or \nLoss From Business (Sole Proprietor) and Schedule SE, Self-employment Tax to your Form 1040. After you formally \nretire, you would do the same if you continue to receive these types of income.\nWhen retired, you may receive a Form SSA-1099 for social security benefits and/or a Form 1099-R for pension \nincome. You will include these types of retirement income on your Form 1040, in addition to any other income you \nmay have received during the tax year.\nWHAT TYPES OF INCOME ARE TAXABLE?\nThe types of income which are taxable include, but are not limited to: military retirement pay, all or part of pensions \nand annuities, all or part of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA), unemployment compensation, gambling income, \nbonuses and awards for outstanding work, alimony or prizes. A portion of your social security benefits may be taxable \nbased on your other income and filing status.\nFor additional information see Publication 525, Taxable and Non-taxable Income\nWHAT TYPES OF INCOME ARE NON-TAXABLE?\nSome income is not subject to tax. A few examples are veteran’s benefits, disability pay for certain military or \ngovernment related incidents, worker’s compensation, and cash rebates from a dealer or manufacturer of an item \nyou purchase.\nFor additional information see Publication 525, Taxable and Non-taxable Income\nWHY IS MY PENSION INCOME TAXED?\nYour pension will be reported on a Form 1099-R, Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing \nPlans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc. Form 1099-R will show you how much you contributed to the plan and how \nmuch tax was withheld. Your pension could be fully or partially taxable depending on how the money was put into the \npension plan. If all the money was contributed by the employer or the money was not taxed before going into the plan \n(pre-tax), it would be taxable. When your contributions (basis) to the plan are from already-taxed dollars (after-tax), \nthat part is not taxed, but must be recovered over your life expectancy. For new retirees, you will generally use the \n\"simplified method\" to compute the taxable portion of your pension. The worksheet to determine the taxable and \nnon-taxable portion of your pension and annuity income is in the Instructions for Form 1040 and Form 1040-SR. ​\nFor additional information see Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income.\nCONTINUED...\nLIFECYCLESERIES\nTax Guide \nfor the Retiree\nThis brochure is intended for individuals who recently retired or \nhave retirement plans in their near future\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nCAN MY PENSION BE TAKEN OUT AS ONE LUMP-SUM PAYMENT?\nIf you withdraw the full amount in your pension account, part or all will be taxable in the year received. You may \nwant to consider rolling it over into another pension plan or a traditional IRA to avoid paying a large amount of tax \nin one year.\nNOTE: Before withdrawing any funds from a retirement account (IRA, 401-K, Thrift Savings, etc.), consult with a tax professional to \nunderstand potential tax consequences.\nWHEN AM I REQUIRED TO WITHDRAW MONEY FROM MY RETIREMENT \nACCOUNTS?\nYour required minimum distribution (RMD) is the minimum amount you must withdraw from your account each \nyear. You must generally begin to receive distributions from your qualified retirement plan at age 73, or when \nyou retire, whichever is later. You generally have to start taking withdrawals from your IRA when you reach age \n73. However, the first payment can be delayed until April 1 of the year after you reach the age of 73. You must \nreceive at least the RMD for each year by December 31 of that year. If no distribution is made in your starting \nyear, the RMDs for 2 years must be made the following year (one by April 1 and one by December 31). \nRoth IRAs do not require withdrawals until after the death of the owner.\nFor additional information see Publication 575, Pension & Annuity Income and Publication 590-B, \nDistributions for Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\n\u0007HOW DO I DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF MY SOCIAL SECURITY IS TAXABLE?\nCompare the base amount found in Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement \nBenefits, to the total of one-half of your social security benefits plus all of your other income (including tax-\nexempt income). If the base amount exceeds your income computation, then your social security is non-taxable. \nFor the most complete calculation, you should use the worksheets found in Publication 915 or the instruction \nbooks for the 1040 series.\nI AM RETIRED AND RECEIVE SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT I HAVE NOW TAKEN \nA PART TIME JOB. WHY ARE THEY TAKING SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES OUT \nOF MY PAY?\n\u0007The Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or FICA, provides for a Federal System of old-age, survivors, disability, \nand hospital insurance. The old-age, survivors, and disability insurance part is financed by the social security \ntax. Generally, employee wages are subject to social security and Medicare taxes regardless of the employee’s \nage or whether he or she is receiving social security benefits.\nWILL TAXES BE WITHHELD FROM MY INCOME OR WILL I HAVE TO MAKE \nESTIMATED TAX PAMENTS? \nOur tax law provides for a pay-as-you-go system which requires taxes to be paid on income as it is received. \nThere are two ways which taxes are typically paid: \n\u0007Tax Withholding – You can request federal tax be withheld from your pension, social security, unemployment \ncompensation, etc., by submitting the appropriate following form to the payer of the income:\n\t\ny Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate - Used for wages and military retirement pay \n\t\ny Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate for Pension or Annuity Payments - Used for pensions and annuities\n\t\ny Form W-4V, Voluntary Withholding Request - Used for social security, unemployment compensation, and \nrailroad retirement income\nTo ensure you do not have too much or too little income tax withheld use the Tax Withholding Estimator. \nYou may use the results of this program to complete the appropriate withholding form.\nCONTINUED...\nLIFECYCLESERIES\n\u0007Estimated Tax Payment – If you have not paid enough federal tax through withholding or receive income \nthat is not subject to withholding, you should make estimated tax payments . Use the worksheet in Form 1040-\nES, Estimated Taxes for Individuals to figure the amount of estimated taxes to pay to Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS).  You can mail a check or money order with Form 1040-ES voucher or make a payment through one of the \nonline payment options. Paying online is convenient and secure and helps make sure we get your payments on \ntime. To pay your taxes online or for more information, go to IRS.gov/Payments. \nEstimated tax payments are due each year on April 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and January 15th of the \nfollowing year.\nExample: John realizes that selling his mutual funds in December resulted in a large gain. He can estimate the \neffect of that gain and pay the amount by January 15th, to avoid a penalty.\n\u0007NOTE: If you do not make sufficient and timely federal tax payments, you could incur an estimated tax penalty.\nFor additional information see Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax.\nWHERE CAN I CHANGE MY WITHHOLDING IF I'M A MILITARY RETIREE?\nThere are two ways to change your withholding.
