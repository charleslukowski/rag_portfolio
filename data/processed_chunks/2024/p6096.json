See Definitions, later.\nWhat To File\nSubmit one copy of Form 4461-C for \neach separate adoption agreement or \nfor each single document plan where \nno adoption agreement is used. For \napproval, file this application and each \napplicable document listed in line 12(a). \nA mass submitter should also file a \nseparate Form 4461-C for each word- \nfor-word identical adopter or minor \nmodifier adopter of the plan.\nMultiple adoption agreement plans. \nA provider may use one basic plan \ndocument for several plans. A provider \nmay, for example, use one basic plan \ndocument for a governmental plan, a \nplan of a church or qualified church \ncontrolled organization (QCCO), \nand a plan of a non-QCCO that use \nseparate adoption agreements. In \naddition, a single adoption agreement \nmay be drafted to cover multiple types \nof eligible employers. However, the \nsame basic plan document may not be \nused for a 403(b) plan intended to be a \nRetirement Income Account and a 403(b) \nplan not intended to be Retirement \nIncome Account. See section 4 of Rev. \nProc. 2021-37 for the definitions of \ngovernmental plan, church, QCCO, \nnon-QCCO, Retirement Income Account, \nand eligible employer. In the case of \na simultaneous submission of plans \nusing the same basic plan document, \nsubmit only one copy of the basic \nplan document. If the requests aren’t \nsimultaneous, submit separate basic \nplan documents and include a cover \nletter identifying the original submission. \nThe number assigned to the basic plan \ndocument must remain the same as in \nthe prior submission. Standardized and \nNonstandardized plans may not be set \nforth in a single adoption agreement.\nTwo or more single document plans. \nA single document plan may be used by \nmore than one type of eligible employer; \nhowever, a Retirement Income Account \nplan must always be filed as a separate \nsingle document plan. Standardized \nand Nonstandardized plans may not be \ncombined in one single document plan.\nWhere To File\nAs of August 1, 2024, Form 4461‑C \napplications must be submitted \nelectronically through Pay.gov. \nTo submit Form 4461-C, you must: \nRegister for an account on Pay.gov, \nEnter “4461-C” in the search box, select \nForm 4461-C and Complete the form.\nPay.gov can accommodate only \none uploaded file.

The portion of \nthe plan containing all the options the \nadopting employer may select. The \nadoption agreement may include blanks \nor fill-in provisions for the employer to \ncomplete if it also includes parameters \non these provisions that preclude an \nemployer from completing them in a \nmanner that could violate the 403(b) \nrequirements. Each separate adoption \nagreement is treated as a separate plan \nand will receive its own opinion letter.\nBasic plan document. The portion of \nthe plan containing all the nonelective \nprovisions applicable to all adopting \nemployers. No options (including blanks \nto be completed) may be provided in the \nbasic plan document except for options in \nflexible plans.\nSingle document plan. A single \ndocument plan consists of a single \nplan document without an adoption \nagreement. A single document plan may \ncontain alternate paragraphs and options \nthat may be selected by an adopting \nemployer. A single document plan may \ninclude blanks or fill-in provisions for \nthe employer to complete only if the \nplan also includes parameters on these \nprovisions that preclude an employer \nfrom completing them in a manner that \ncould violate the 403(b) requirements.\nFlexible plan. A plan submitted by a \nmass submitter which contains certain \noptional provisions as allowed by section \n11.03(1) of Revenue Procedure (Rev. \nProc.). 2021-37. Providers who adopt a \nflexible plan may include or delete any \noptional provision designated as such in \nthe mass submitter’s plan. A flexible plan \nadopted by a provider that differs from \nthe mass submitter plan only because of \nthe deletion of certain optional provisions \nwill be treated as a plan that is word-for-\nword identical to the mass submitter plan.\nMass submitter. As set forth in Rev. \nProc. 2021-37, any entity that submits \napplications on behalf of at least 15 \nunaffiliated providers each of which is \nsponsoring, on a word-for-word identical \nbasis, the same plan. A mass submitter \nis  treated as a mass submitter with \nrespect to all its plans, provided the 15- \nunaffiliated-provider requirement is met \nwith respect to at least one plan.\nAffiliation is determined under \nSections 414(b) and (c). Any law firm, \naccounting firm, consulting firm, or similar \norganization, will be considered to be \naffiliated with its partners, members, \nassociates, or similar affiliated persons. \nFor purposes of determining whether 15 \nunaffiliated providers offer, on a word-\nfor-word identical basis, the same 403(b) \npre-approved plan, a mass submitter \nthat is also a provider is treated as an \nunaffiliated provider.\nOpinion letter. An opinion letter is a \nwritten statement issued by the IRS to a \nprovider or mass submitter that the form \nof a 403(b) pre-approved plan satisfies \nthe 403(b) requirements.\n403(b) Pre-approved plan. A 403(b) \npre-approved plan is a plan (including a \nplan covering self-employed individuals) \nthat is made available by a provider for \nadoption by eligible employers. The term \n403(b) pre-approved plan includes both \nstandardized and nonstandardized plans. \nA 403(b) pre-approved plan may be an \nadoption agreement plan or a single \ndocument plan. An adoption agreement \nplan consists of a basic plan document \nand an adoption agreement. A single \ndocument plan consists of a single plan \ndocument offered by a provider without \nan adoption agreement.\nProvider. A provider is any person \n(including a mass submitter, if applicable) \nthat (1) has an established place of \nbusiness in the United States where it is \naccessible during every business day; \nand (2) represents to the IRS that it has \nat least 15 eligible employers, each of \nwhich is reasonably expected to adopt \none of the 403(b) pre-approved plans \nof the provider. A provider may apply for \nopinion letters for any number of 403(b) \npre-approved plans.\nA provider also includes any person \nthat has an established place of business \nin the United States where it is accessible \nduring every business day and offers a \nplan as a word-for-word identical adopter \nor minor modifier adopter of a plan of a \nmass submitter, regardless of the number \nof eligible employers that are expected to \nadopt the plan.\nStandardized plan. A standardized plan \nis a 403(b) pre-approved plan that meets \nthe requirements of section 5.18 of Rev. \nProc. 2021-37.\nNonstandardized plan. A \nnonstandardized plan is a 403(b) pre-\napproved plan that is not a standardized \nplan.\nSpecific Instructions\nLine 1.

Each different adoption \nagreement designed to accompany \na single basic plan document should \nbe given a different three-digit numbe \nbeginning with “001.” For example, if the \nfirst basic plan document of a provider \nhas four separate adoption agreements, \nthey should be numbered “001” through \n“004,” and the provider should submit \nfour separate Forms 4461-C. Adoption \nagreements submitted with the second \nor any subsequent basic plan documents \n(that aren’t word-for-word identical \nto a previously submitted basic plan \ndocument) should be similarly numbered \nbeginning with “001.” \nLine 6.
