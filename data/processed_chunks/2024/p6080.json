For purposes of the Low-Income \nCommunities Bonus Credit Program (Program), taxpayers may only request an allocation transfer (Allocation \nTransfer Request) when there is (1) a sale or transfer of a facility from one taxpayer to another taxpayer, and \n(2) the original owner has already applied for and been awarded an allocation of Capacity Limitation for the \napplicable facility or facilities. This process is not available if the original owner and taxpayer has already \nplaced the facility in service, before selling or transferring the facility.\n\t\nii \t\nLast Updated: 9/13/24\nTable of Content\nThe Allocation Transfer Request is made through the Applicant Portal. Throughout this document and the \nApplicant Portal, the original owner/taxpayer will be referred to as the “Awardee.” The successor taxpayer \nthat currently owns the facility will be referred to as the “Successor Awardee.” If a facility was transferred to \nanother taxpayer without a true sale, the terms Successor Awardee and Awardee will still be applied to the \ntransaction for purposes of this transfer process and the Applicant Portal. If you/your organization were the \ntransferor of a facility/or facilities, you/your organization are/is the Awardee. If you/your organization were the \ntransferee that now owns the facility, you/your organization are/is the Successor Awardee. Please also note, \nthe allocation of Capacity Limitation will be associated with the Awardee name and taxpayer identification \nnumber until completion of an Allocation Transfer Request.\nOverview Illustration of Allocation Transfer Request Process\nPlease note that if a taxpayer received an allocation for their facility, based, in part, on meeting the ownership \ncriteria, and sold or transferred the facility, that taxpayer should refer to §1.48(e)-1(m)(5) of the Treasury \nRegulations to determine if a disqualification event has occurred.\nLow-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program\t\n1\t\nApplicant User Guide\nSuccessor Awardee – Initiating Allocation Transfer Request \nHelp Center Allocation Transfer Request Page \nSuccessor Awardee – Initiating Allocation Transfer Request \nHelp Center Allocation Transfer Request Page \nThe Successor Awardee must initiate and submit the Allocation Transfer Request. However, before a \nSuccessor Awardee can initiate an Allocation Transfer Request, that Successor Awardee must be registered \nas an applicant in the Applicant Portal. To register, please refer to the Applicant User Guide on the Program \nhomepage for registration instructions. If a Successor Awardee is already registered in the Applicant Portal \nbecause the Successor Awardee has previously submitted an application for another facility, that Successor \nAwardee does not need to re-register. \nThe first step to initiate an Allocation Transfer Request is for the Successor Awardee to login to the Applicant \nPortal and navigate to the Help Center, which can be found on the navigation bar at the top of the Applicant \nPortal. The Successor Awardee will then select Initiate Allocation Transfer Request (right-most, blue box in the \nscreenshot below).\nHelp Center\n Selecting this box will lead the Successor Awardee to the Allocation Transfer Request Page. \nLow-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program\t\n2\t\nApplicant User Guide\nSuccessor Awardee – Submit Allocation Transfer Request\nSubmit Allocation Transfer Request\nSuccessor Awardee – Submit Allocation Transfer Request\nHelp Center Allocation Transfer Request Page \nThis page contains the link to the Applicant Portal feature to perform the Allocation Transfer Request. \nSuccessor Awardees should ensure that they have gathered all the information necessary to complete the \nrequest before initiating a request.

There is an Awardee Form 8821 and a Successor \nAwardee Form 8821 linked on the Help Center Allocation Transfer Request page. \nThe Successor Awardee completes the Successor Awardee Form 8821 using the Successor Awardee’s \ntaxpayer name and address in Line 1 and the Awardee’s name and address in Line 2.

However, the Control Numbers must be for allocations \nawarded to the same taxpayer organization and with the same Awardee primary contact information. \nIf there are two or more primary contacts associated with one Awardee Organization, then the \nSuccessor Awardee must submit a separate Allocation Transfer Request for the allocation requests for \nControl Numbers assigned to each Awardee Organization Primary Contact. If all Control Numbers in an \nAllocation Transfer Request are not associated with a particular application, Organization, and Primary \nContact then the request will be denied.\nMoreover, Successor Awardees cannot submit a single Allocation Transfer Request for Control \nNumbers associated with different Organizations.
