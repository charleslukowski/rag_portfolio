Failure to make regular monthly payments until you have received a final decision letter will cause your offer to be \nreturned with no appeal rights.

I authorize the IRS to amend Section 1 or Section 2 if I failed to list any of my assessed \ntax debt or tax debt assessed before acceptance of my offer. By submitting a joint offer, both signers grant \napproval to the Internal Revenue Service to disclose the existence of any separate liabilities owed.\nb) I also authorize the IRS to amend Section 1 or Section 2 by removing any tax years on which there is currently \nno outstanding liability. I understand that my offer will be accepted, by law, unless the IRS notifies me otherwise, \nin writing, within 24 months of the date my offer was received by our IRS centralized offer in compromise unit, \nlocated in  Memphis/Brookhaven.

I also understand that if any tax debt that \nis included in the offer is in dispute in any judicial proceeding that tax debt will not be included in determining the \nexpiration of the 24-month period.

    "text": "Section 7 (Continued)\nOffer Terms \nc) I voluntarily submit the payments made on this offer and understand that they will not be returned even if I \nwithdraw the offer or the IRS rejects or returns the offer. Unless I designate how to apply each required payment \nin Section 5, the IRS will apply my payment in the best interest of the government, choosing which tax years and \ntax debts to pay off. The IRS will also keep my application fee unless the offer is not accepted for processing. \nIRS will keep my payments, \nfees, and some refunds. \nd) I understand that if I checked the Low-Income Certification in Section 1, then no payments are required. If I \nqualify for the Low-Income Certification and voluntarily submit payments, all money will be applied to my tax debt \nand will not be returned to me.\ne) Treas. Reg. section 301.7122(e)(5) states, in part, that acceptance of an offer in compromise will conclusively \nsettle the liability for the tax periods specified in the offer. To enforce the regulation as a contract term, I agree \nthat I cannot file an amended return for the tax years listed on Form 656 after the offer is accepted. Further, I \nagree that I will not file an amended return for the tax years listed on Form 656 after I have submitted my offer \nand while my offer remains pending [see section 7(j) below] with the Service. The filing of the amended return \ncould be considered grounds for termination. In addition, any refunds related to an amended return filed for a tax \nyear which has an ending date prior to offer acceptance will be offset to the tax liability. If I receive a refund prior \nto offer acceptance, or based on an amended return for any tax periods extending to the date my offer is \naccepted, I will return the refund within 30 days of receiving the refund. The IRS will keep any refund, including \ninterest, that I might be due for tax assessed before the date the IRS accepts my offer. Systemic offset of \noverpayments will continue in accordance with IRC 6402(a) prior to the offer acceptance date. I understand that \nmy tax refund may be offset to the tax liability while the offer is pending, but that assistance could be available for \ntaxpayers (other than businesses) facing an economic hardship.\nf) I understand that the amount I am offering may not include part or all of an expected or current tax refund, \nmoney already paid, funds attached by any collection action, or anticipated benefits from a capital or net operating \nloss.\ng) The IRS will keep any monies it has collected prior to this offer. Under section 6331(k), the IRS may levy on my \nproperty and rights to property up to the time that the IRS official signs and acknowledges my offer as pending. \nThe IRS may keep any proceeds arising from such a levy. No levy will be issued on individual shared \nresponsibility payments. However, if the IRS served a continuous levy on wages, salary, or certain federal \npayments under sections 6331(e) or (h), then the IRS could choose to either retain or release the levy.\nh) The IRS will keep any payments that I make related to this offer. I agree that any funds submitted with this offer \nwill be treated as a payment. I also agree that any funds submitted with periodic payments made after the \nsubmission of this offer and prior to the acceptance, rejection, or return of this offer will be treated as payments.\ni) If my offer is accepted and my final payment is more than the agreed amount, the IRS will not return the \ndifference, but will apply the entire payment to my tax debt. \nj) Once an authorized IRS official signs this form, my offer is considered pending as of that signature date and it \nremains pending until the IRS accepts, rejects, or returns my offer, or I withdraw my offer. An offer is also \nconsidered pending for 30 days after any rejection of my offer by the IRS, and during the time that any rejection of \nmy offer is being considered by the Appeals Office. An offer will be considered withdrawn when the IRS receives \nmy written notification of withdrawal by personal delivery or certified mail or when I inform the IRS of my \nwithdrawal by other means and the IRS acknowledges in writing my intent to withdraw the offer. For joint offers in \ncompromise, if one spouse withdraws the offer, the offer will be considered to be withdrawn.\nPending status of an offer and \nright to appeal \nk) I waive the right to an Appeals hearing if I do not request a hearing in writing within 30 days of the date the IRS \nnotifies me of the decision to reject the offer.\nl) As both an express condition and as a contractual promise, I will strictly comply with all provisions of the internal \nrevenue laws, including requirements to timely file tax returns and timely pay taxes for the five year period \nbeginning with the date of acceptance of this offer and ending through the fifth year. I agree to promptly pay any \nliabilities assessed after acceptance of this offer for tax years ending prior to acceptance of this offer that were not \notherwise identified in Section 1 or Section 2 of this agreement. I also understand that during the five year period I \ncannot request an installment agreement for unpaid taxes incurred before or after the accepted offer. I understand \nthat I cannot request an offer for a tax liability during the five year period. If this is an offer being submitted for joint \ntax debt, and one of us does not comply with future obligations, only the non-compliant taxpayer will be in default \nof this agreement. An accepted offer will not be defaulted solely due to the assessment of an individual shared \nresponsibility payment. I understand failure to pay any restitution-based assessments will provide basis for the \ndefault of my offer acceptance for administrative tax periods included on this Form 656.\nI must comply with my future \ntax obligations and understand \nI remain liable for the full \namount of my tax debt until all \nterms and conditions of this \noffer have  been met. \nm) I agree that I will remain liable for the full amount of the tax liability, accrued penalties and interest, until I have \nmet all of the terms and conditions of this offer. Penalties and interest will continue to accrue until all payment \nterms of the offer have been met. If I file for bankruptcy before the terms and conditions of the offer are met, I \nagree that the IRS may file a claim for the full amount of the tax liability, accrued penalties and interest, and that \nany claim the IRS files in the bankruptcy proceeding will be a tax claim.\nn) Once the IRS accepts my offer in writing, I have no right to challenge the tax debt(s) in court or by filing a \nrefund claim or refund suit for any liability or period listed in Section 1 or Section 2, even if the IRS defaults or \nrescinds the offer.\nCatalog Number 16728N\nwww.irs.gov\nForm 656 (Rev. 4-2025) \nPage 6",

I agree that the date by which the IRS must assess my tax debt will now be the \ndate by which my debt must currently be assessed plus the period of time my offer is pending plus one additional \nyear if the IRS rejects, returns, or terminates my offer or I withdraw it. (Paragraph (j) of this section defines \npending and withdrawal.) I understand that I have the right not to waive the statutory period of assessment or to \nlimit the waiver to a certain length or certain periods or issues. I understand, however, that the IRS may not \nconsider my offer if I refuse to waive the statutory period of assessment or if I provide only a limited waiver.

By submitting this offer I immediately \nwithdraw any pending installment agreement that is on file for all tax periods and I understand a pending \ninstallment agreement (an installment agreement that has been accepted for processing but the IRS has not \naccepted its terms) will not be automatically reinstated after the offer is closed.\nI agree to waive time limits \nprovided by law. \nq) The IRS may file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien during consideration of the offer or for offers that will be paid \nover time. If the offer is accepted, the tax lien(s) for the periods and taxes listed in Section 1 will generally be \nreleased within 45 days after the final payment has been received and verified. The time it takes to transfer funds \nto the IRS from commercial institutions varies based on the form of payment.

In addition, I authorize the IRS to request a consumer report on me \nfrom a credit bureau. \nI authorize the IRS to contact  \nrelevant third parties in order to \nprocess my offer. \nt) I understand if the liability sought to be compromised is the joint and individual liability of myself and my co-\nobligor(s) and I am submitting this offer to compromise my individual liability only, then if this offer is accepted, it \ndoes not release or discharge my co-obligor(s) from liability.
