    "text": "Introduction\nThis publication outlines the eligibility, administrative and program requirements for participating in \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) grant program. In addition, \nit provides detailed instructions on how to apply as well as the evaluative criteria used to rank all \napplications. Since acceptance is based on the applicants’ responses to the criteria outlined within this \npublication, completeness, accuracy and conformity to this criteria is essential. The terms “cooperative \nagreement” and “grant” are used interchangeably throughout this publication.\nPlease retain this publication along with the required forms and certifications submitted with your \napplication. If your organization is awarded a grant, retention of this publication throughout the entire \ngrant cycle will provide useful information in understanding the TCE program expectations and \nrequirements.\nListed below are the most common errors encountered during previous years’ application period:\n•\t  \u0007Incomplete applications — Applications did not contain all required information. Refer to the \nApplication Assembly section or the Form 14204, TCE Program Application Checklist and Contact \nSheet, that are included within this publication for the requirements. Only applications with all \nrequired information are reviewed for eligibility. Technical ranking occurs simultaneously with \nGrant Program Office (GPO) evaluation. Any missing information identified by the GPO during its \nevaluation may or may not be considered by technical evaluators depending on when the review is \ncompleted. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure all information is submitted. Incomplete \napplications meeting basic eligibility will be scored based on the information available at time of \nreview. Therefore, it is extremely important that the submission is complete. If your application is not \ncomplete, you will be notified that it is incomplete and will not be considered further.\n•\t  \u0007Applicants did not meet eligibility criteria for tax compliance — The applicant organization had not \nfiled all required federal tax returns, federal information returns, or paid all federal taxes.  Applicants \nshould be compliant at the time of application, award, and remain in compliance for the duration of \nthe grant period.\n•\t  \u0007Registration or renewal in SAM did not occur — In order for an organization to be eligible for an \naward they must register or re-register in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.\ngov. Organizations must renew their registration once a year in order to maintain active status.\n•\t  \u0007All evaluative criteria were not addressed — Applicants did not provide all the information requested \nthus reducing the amount of points available for award during the technical evaluation.\n•\t  Pages or requested information was missing from the narrative.\n•\t Multi-year criteria was not checked — Applicants did not verify they met the eligibility criteria for a \nmulti-year grant prior to making the election for consideration. Please double check to ensure your \norganization is eligible.\nTCE Grant Program Timeline is as follows:\nGrant Timeline\nApplication Period\nMay 1 - May 31\nReview and Ranking\nJune 1 - September 30\nNotification of selection/non-selection\nOctober 1\nPeriod of Performance\nOctober 1 - September 30\nNote:  If any of these dates within the Grant Timeline falls on a weekend, the next business day will be \nused as the deadline.\n5\nTCE Program Overview\nThe Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program offers FREE tax help to individuals who are age 60 \nor older. Section 163 of the Revenue Act of 1978, Public Law No. 95-600, 92 Stat. 2810, November \n6, 1978, authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enter into agreements with private or public \nnonprofit agencies and organizations, which will provide training and technical assistance to volunteers \nwho provide FREE tax counseling and assistance to elderly individuals in the preparation of their federal \nincome tax returns.\nEligible agencies and organizations compete for acceptance as a TCE grant recipient. Applicants must \nbe experienced in coordinating volunteer programs, with experience in income tax return preparation. \nEligible agencies and organizations receive grants to conduct local TCE Programs. Tax return preparation \nassistance is provided to elderly taxpayers during the usual period for filing federal income tax returns, \nwhich is from January 1 to April 15 each year. However, the program activities required to ensure that \nelderly taxpayers receive efficient and quality tax assistance can be conducted year-round.\nForm 9661, TCE Cooperative Agreement, and Publication 5245, TCE Program Terms and Conditions, \ndefine the functions the grant recipient and IRS will perform, the maximum amount of funding available \nfor reimbursement and administrative purposes, the minimum number of federal tax returns to be \naccomplished and other information. Approval for a three-year multi-year award is available for agencies \nand organizations that are interested and request consideration when submitting an application. \nConsideration is limited to those applicants that meet all eligibility requirements. The second and third \nyears will be funded subject to satisfactory performance, compliance with program terms, and availability \nof appropriated funds. Funds awarded in a subsequent year may or may not be the same as awarded in \nthe prior year.\nOrganizations that are awarded a grant are responsible for all aspects of operating a TCE Program \nincluding, but not limited to, publicity, recruitment, training, site selection and management of \nvolunteers. The necessity for renegotiation, suspension, or termination of a Cooperative Agreement \nwill be determined solely by the Internal Revenue Service and will not be subject to appeal. The TCE \nGrant Program is managed by the Stakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication (SPEC) \norganization of the IRS. SPEC is responsible for providing oversight, guidance and assistance to TCE \ngrant recipient organizations. There are no cost sharing or matching requirements for the TCE Program.\nTCE Program Requirements\nEligibility Criteria\n1.

    "text": "Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code (organizations that have applied for recognition as tax-\nexempt but have not received their IRS determination letter confirming the organization as exempt \nare not eligible for this grant) or be a federally recognized Indian tribal government;\n\t b.\t \u0007Have experience in coordinating volunteer programs with experience in income tax return \npreparation; and;\n\t c.\t Not be a federal, state, or local governmental agency or organization.\n6\nEligibility Criteria\n2. Tax Compliance\nThe organization performance must be in compliance at the time of application, and remain in compliance for \nthe duration of the performance period with all federal tax obligations; this includes filing all required federal \ninformation and tax returns and payment of all federal taxes, penalties, and interest. The Grant Program \nOffice will check the last five years of IRS records to confirm compliance. The entity information shown in the \napplication must agree with IRS records. Organizations determined to be ineligible or not recommended for \naward are not researched for tax compliance, therefore, existing problems with tax compliance may not be \nidentified on all applicants.\nExamples of non-compliance would be:\n•\t \tA balance due on the account.\n•\t \t\u0007A required federal information return or tax return has not been submitted or processed within the last \nfive years.\n•\t \tAn Employer Identification Number (EIN) that belongs to a different entity than shown on the application.\nIf your organization is not required to file a federal information return or tax return, please submit a statement \non your organization’s letterhead explaining why you are not required to file.\nPlease do not assume that you are tax compliant. Have the person in your organization responsible \nfor filing returns contact the IRS at 877.829.5500 to check for any monies owed or returns not filed. \nPlease ensure filing requirement information is correct, prior to submitting your application.\nIf you identify any issues with tax compliance, be sure to indicate this on the SF 424, Application for Federal \nAssistance, block 20, and attach a statement explaining the issue. The SF 424 provides additional space for \nexplaining any federal debt at the end of the form. For example, if a return was not filed because it was not \nrequired, include a statement containing the reason, the type of return (i.e., Form 990, 940, 941, etc.) and the \ntax period. If you are working with someone at the IRS to resolve an outstanding issue, please provide their \nname, office in which they work, and phone number. Similar statements should be submitted for monies owed \nor incorrect entity information. Disclosures of situations where federal returns are not filed and/or monies are \nowed do not automatically qualify you as eligible for this grant. Information submitted about tax compliance \nissues will be considered on the specific merits of the situation.\nApplicants MUST submit a Form 14335, Contact Information for VITA and TCE Grant Programs, with every \napplication.  Make sure this form is completed in its entirety and the person listed as the tax matters contact \non the Form 14335 is authorized to receive and discuss the return information. \n3. Timely Reporting\nOrganizations that participated in the TCE or VITA Grant programs in prior years must \nhave submitted all required reports timely as stated in the Management of Funds section \nof this publication, including financial forms (semi-annual/annual), the final narrative \nreport and all of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Payment \nManagement System (PMS) online Federal Financial Reports (Standard Form 425) that \nare due quarterly. Failure to timely complete these reports will eliminate the applicant \nfrom being eligible for a grant during this grant cycle.\n4. Capacity to File Electronically\nIt is the intention that grant recipients electronically file all eligible returns. It is a goal for \nthe TCE program that grant recipients electronically file at least sixty-five percent of all returns completed for \ntaxpayers aged 60+. Grant applicants must address their capacity to electronically file returns. Capacity to file \nelectronically includes access to the Internet for transmission of returns along with the computers and printers \nneeded to support return preparation. IRS provides the tax preparation software. Monies from the grant \ncannot be used to purchase tax preparation software.\nTCE Program Requirements\n7\n5. Administrative\nGrant award administrative requirements are set forth in OMB Circulars. The administrative requirements \napplicable to the TCE Grant are contained in 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost \nPrinciples, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.\n6. Debarment or Suspension\nAs part of the application, you are required to complete certifications and assurances. As part of eligibility, \nthe Grant Program Office will check the individuals listed on the Standard Form 424, Application for Federal \nAssistance, and key individuals in the Program and Budget Plan narratives to ensure they are not debarred, \nsuspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for a federal award. You may check this yourself before \napplying by visiting the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. If you identify incorrect \ninformation about your organization or individuals within your organization, you should contact the agency that \nreported the information.\n7. Audit Requirements\nAudit requirements applicable to grant award recipients are described in 2 CFR Part 200. If you expend less \nthan $1,000,000 in total federal awards during your fiscal year, no audit requirements are applicable. Total \nfederal awards includes all sources of federal funding, not just the funds received from IRS in support of \nTCE. If you expend $1,000,000 or more during your fiscal year in federal awards you must arrange for an \naudit by an independent auditor in accordance with the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards \ndeveloped by the Comptroller General of the United States. The costs of audits performed in compliance \nwith 2 CFR Part 200 are allowable. An audit under 2 CFR Part 200 is organization wide. Financial records, \nsupporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for \na period of three years from the date of submission of the final report for the grant cycle, subject to certain \nexceptions set forth in 2 CFR Part 200.\nThe Federal Audit Clearinghouse operates on behalf of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and \nits primary purpose is to disseminate audit information to federal agencies and the public. If the most recent \naudit showed an unfavorable finding, it will not automatically disqualify you from consideration; however, more \ninformation may be requested to ensure any deficiencies noted in the audit have been corrected. Detailed \ninformation can be obtained from 2 CFR Part 200, which can be found at www.ecfr.gov. The Grant Program \nOffice will review the audit reports located at https://harvester.census.gov/facweb/.\nBefore Completing Your Application\nBefore submitting a grant application, all organizations should take the following actions:\n•\t  Secure a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI),\n•\t  Register with the System for Award Management (SAM), and/or\n•\t  Check both to ensure applicant information is correct and accounts are still active.\n•\t  Determine if application is subject to review by the state under Executive Order 12372.\n•\t  Register with Grants.gov in order to submit application electronically.\nTCE Program Requirements\n8\n1. Unique Entity Identifier\n•\t The Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) is generated in the System for Award Management, as the official \nidentifier for doing business with the government.\n•\t The General Services Administration (GSA) will supply and generate a non-proprietary UEI for \nidentifying entities during the awards process for things like contracts, grants and cooperative \nagreements — in SAM.gov and other systems.\n•\t  GSA has streamlined the UEI request, registration and support process by allowing entities to \nhandle all three through www.SAM.gov. \nCustomer Support\nOrganizations will go to, www.SAM.gov, to: \n•\t Request their UEI and entity information to do business with the U.S. Government.\n•\t Make any updates to their legal business name and physical address associated with the UEI.\n•\t Find customer support at a help desk for all UEI and entity registration issues.\nApplicants must include their UEI when applying to participate in the TCE Program.

System for Award Management (SAM)\nSystem for Award Management (SAM) is the primary registrant database of contracts and assistance \nawards for the federal government. The purpose of the SAM is to facilitate paperless payment through \nelectronic funds transfer. The registration process also provides basic information relevant to procurement \nand financial transactions.\nApplicants must register with SAM, maintain an active registration during the application and evaluation \nperiod and then throughout the grant period and final reporting. Register early. Please give yourself \nplenty of time before the application submission deadline.

Check when your \nregistration will expire and update. Entities may update as often as needed, but renewal of the registration \nis required at least annually. The complete resource for SAM registration is located at www.sam.gov.\nAll entities registering for All Awards or Federal Assistance Only, are required to review the Financial \nAssistance Representations and Certifications.  These are a common set of certifications and \nrepresentations required by Federal statutes or regulations in accordance with grant guidance under \nTitle 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  If you intend to apply or are a recipient of a Federal grant \nor cooperative agreement, you must agree to the grants certifications and representations in the \nRepresentations and Certifications section of your entity registration.  A list of these certifications are \nincluded in Appendix A, Exhibit 2, however your agreement MUST be made in www.sam.gov.\nOnce you are registered in SAM, SAM will provide advance notification to you when you need to renew \nyour registration. This must be done annually in order to maintain active status. Visit www.sam.gov for \nmore information. Failure to maintain an active registration in SAM will result in non-consideration of your \napplication.\nBefore Completing Your Application\n9\n3. Intergovernmental Review - Required under Executive Order 12372\nExecutive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, was issued with the desire \nto foster the intergovernmental partnership and strengthen federalism by relying on state and local \nprocesses for the coordination and review of proposed federal financial assistance and direct federal \ndevelopment.  The Order allows each state to designate an entity to perform this function. Review the \nState Point of Contact (SPOC) List at Office of Federal Financial Management to determine if your state \nis participating. States that are not listed have chosen not to participate in the intergovernmental review \nprocess. If you are located within a state that has chosen not to participate, you may send application \nmaterials directly to a federal awarding agency. Please check the appropriate item in Block 19 of the SF \n424, Application for Federal Assistance, included within this application package under Appendix A.\n4.\t Grants.gov Registration\nNow that your SAM registration is active, you’re ready to register on www.Grants.gov.

An applicant for a multi-year grant must update the required civil rights reporting \ninformation annually.  Upon completion of its review, the Civil Rights Unit will forward a preliminary civil \nrights determination to the SPEC office. Financial assistance shall not be awarded to the applicant until \nthe Civil Rights Unit has issued a preliminary determination of probable or conditional compliance based \non the civil rights requirements reported by the applicant.\nThe Civil Rights Unit may request additional data only to the extent that it is readily available or can \nbe compiled with reasonable effort, and is found to be necessary to make a civil rights compliance \ndetermination. Examples of data and information appropriate for determining compliance with applicable \ncivil rights statutes and implementing regulations may include, but is not limited to:\n1.\t \u0007The manner in which services are or will be provided by the program in question, and related \ndata necessary for determining whether any persons are or will be denied such services on the \nbasis of the prohibited discrimination;\n2.\t Data regarding covered employment, including use or planned use of bilingual public contact \nemployees serving beneficiaries of the program where necessary to permit effective participation \nby beneficiaries unable to speak or understand English;\n3.\t \u0007The location of existing or proposed facilities connected with the program, and related \ninformation adequate for determining whether the location has or will have the effect of \nunnecessarily denying access to any persons on the basis of prohibited discrimination;\n4.\t \u0007The present or proposed membership, by race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability, in \nany planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program; and\n5.\t \u0007Data, such as demographic maps, the racial composition of affected neighborhoods or census \ndata.\n6.\t Race and ethnicity data showing the extent to which beneficiaries receive service from \nthe TCE.\nThe Civil Rights Unit annually conducts selected post-award compliance reviews to ensure civil rights \nrequirements are in place and to provide technical assistance to recipients.

See also 31 CFR Section 21.110 for additional requirements to revise or update \nforms. The certification if required is “The Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans, and Cooperative \nAgreements” published as Appendix A to 31 CFR Part 21 and reprinted in this Publication as the \n“Certification Regarding Lobbying” within the List of Assurances and Certifications, Appendix A, Exhibit \n2. The disclosure form to be filed if required is Standard Form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities \npublished as Appendix B to 31 CFR Part 21 and reprinted in this Publication at Appendix A, Exhibit 3.\n3.\t Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000\nThe Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, as amended (22 USC 7104) requires any agency that \nawards a grant to a private entity to include a condition authorizing the agency to terminate the grant \nor take other remedial actions, without penalty, if the private entity engages in certain activities related \nto trafficking in persons. As part of the implementation of the Act, the Office of Federal Financial \nManagement has established terms that must be included in every grant agreement. See 2 CFR 175.15. \nUnder the Act, a grantee that is a private entity and any sub-recipient that is a private entity may not \nengage in, or use labor recruiters, brokers, or other agents who engage in—\na.\tSevere forms of trafficking in persons;\nb.\tThe procurement of a commercial sex act during the period of time that the award is in effect;\nc.\tThe use of forced labor in the performance of the award;\nd.\tActs that directly support or advance trafficking in persons, including the following acts:\n•\t Destroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or otherwise denying an employee access to that \nemployee’s identity or immigration documents.\n•\t Failing to provide return transportation or pay for return transportation costs to an employee from a \ncountry outside the United States to the country from which the employee was recruited upon the \nend of employment if requested by the employee, unless exempted from the requirement to provide \nor pay for such return transportation by the Federal department or agency providing or entering \ninto the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; or the employee is a victim of human trafficking \nseeking victim services or legal redress in the country of employment or a witness in a human \ntrafficking enforcement action.\n•\t Soliciting a person for the purpose of employment, or offering employment, by means of materially \nfalse or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises regarding that employment.\n•\t Charging recruited employees placement or recruitment fees.\n•\t \u0007Providing or arranging housing that fails to meet the host country housing and safety standards.\nThe IRS may unilaterally terminate the award or take other remedial actions, without penalty, if any \nprivate entity is determined to have violated a prohibition in items a, b, c, or d above or has an employee \nwho is determined by the IRS official authorized to terminate the award to have violated a prohibition in \nitems a, b, c, or d above through conduct that is either:\n•\t Associated with performance under the award; or\nAssurances and Certifications\n14\n•\t \u0007Imputed to the private entity using the standards and due process for imputing the conduct of an \nindividual to an organization that are provided in 2 CFR Part 180, OMB Guidelines to Agencies \non Government-wide Debarment and Suspension (Non Procurement), as implemented by the \nDepartment of the Treasury at 31 CFR Part 19.\n4. Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act\nThe Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) of 2006, as amended, is intended to \nempower Americans with the ability to hold the government accountable for each spending decision. Each \napplicant must ensure it has the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the FFATA \nreporting requirements should it receive funding. OMB has issued guidance to establish requirements \nfor non-federal entities to report information about executive compensation in certain circumstances. For \nmore information, see 2 CFR Part 170.\n5. \tCorporate Felony Convictions\nTCE funds may not be awarded to any corporation that was convicted of a felony criminal violation under \nany Federal law within the preceding 24 months, where the awarding agency is aware of the conviction, \nunless the agency has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and made a determination \nthat denial of the grant is not necessary to protect the interests of the government. You must certify \neither that you are not a corporation or that you have disclosed in your application all your felony criminal \nconvictions that occurred under Federal law within the preceding 24 months. In addition, applicants must \ndisclose all violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially \naffecting the award. Applicants awarded a grant will remain under a duty to disclose these acts and will \nneed to require similar certifications from any grant sub-recipients. To disclose a covered conviction \nor covered violation, record the information specific to the conviction or violation and submit with your \napplication through Grants.gov as an attachment.\n6.\t Buy American Act\nThe Buy American Act, 41 USC 8301-8303, includes a requirement that all un-manufactured articles, \nmaterials, and supplies purchased using grant funds be mined or produced in the United States and that \nall manufactured articles, materials, and supplies purchased using grant funds be manufactured in the \nUnited States substantially all from articles, materials, or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in \nthe United States. A conviction for violating the Buy American Act causes debarment from federal grants \nand contracts. The requirement to Buy American does not apply to information technology that is a \ncommercial item, products for which the expected value of the procurement is $10,000 or less, products \nfor use outside the United States, foreign products when domestic products are unavailable or are of \nunacceptable quality, or foreign products excepted by certain trade agreements. The IRS may waive the \nrequirement to Buy American if its application would be inconsistent with the public interest or the cost \nwould be unreasonable.\n7. Telecommunication and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment\nRecipients and subrecipients are prohibited from obligating or expending grant funds to: \n•\t Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure or obtain equipment, services, or \nsystems that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential \ncomponent of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system as described in Public Law \n115–232, section 889,\n•\t Telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or provided by an entity \nthat the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the National Intelligence or the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, reasonably believes to be an entity owned or controlled \nby, or otherwise connected to, the government of a covered foreign country, and Requirement for \ngrant recipient to comply with 2 CFR 200.216, Prohibition on Certain Telecommunication and Video \nSurveillance Services or Equipment, which prohibits the use of Federal assistance funding on certain \ntelecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment.\nAssurances and Certifications\n15\n8.\t Other Applicable Laws and Regulations\nFederally funded programs are governed by a wide variety of federal laws, regulations, OMB circulars, \nDepartment of Treasury circulars, and Federal management circulars. These include, but are not limited to:\n•\t Restrictions on political activities at 18 USC 595, 598, 600-603;\n•\t The national preservation program requirements at 54 USC 300101 et seq;\n•\t Environmental requirements of the Clean Air Act (42 USC 7401 et seq.);\n•\t The non-pollution requirement of the Federal Water Pollution Control Provisions \n(33 USC 1251 et seq.),\n•\t Whistleblower protections at 41 USC 4712;\n•\t Rules governing allowable costs at 41 USC 4304 and 4310; and\n•\t All additional applicable statutory requirements and all additional applicable requirements in OMB \nCirculars, Department of the Treasury Circulars and Federal Management Circulars, including 2 \nCFR Part 200\nAs referenced under the SAM section, as of February 2, 2019, all entities registering in sam.gov for All \nAwards or Federal Assistance Only, are required to review the Financial Assistance Representations and \nCertifications.  These are a common set of certifications and representations required by Federal statutes \nor regulations in accordance with grant guidance under Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  If \nyou intend to apply or are a recipient of a Federal grant or cooperative agreement, you must agree to the \ngrants certifications and representations in the Representations and Certifications section of your entity \nregistration.  A copy of these can be found in Appendix A, Exhibit 2 but the certification MUST be provided \nin www.sam.gov.\nProgram Coordination\nTo facilitate the management of various program operations, you must designate a Program Coordinator \nto work with the IRS TCE Grant Program Office and the SPEC territory office(s). A Program Coordinator \nmay be a volunteer or a member of your organization’s professional staff. However, if the coordinator(s) is \na member of your staff, no portion of grant funds may be used to pay any portion of their salary.\nThe TCE program was established to provide free tax assistance to individuals age 60 and over (where \na joint return is involved, only one spouse need satisfy the 60 year age requirement); the program must \nbe designed and operated primarily to provide assistance to such individuals. However, assistance \nwith respect to Federal income tax returns may be provided to individuals under 60 and assistance with \nrespect to state and local returns may be provided to individuals of any age if:\n•\t  \u0007providing such assistance is entirely voluntary on the part of those rendering it,\n•\t  \u0007no charge is made for the assistance,\n•\t  \u0007assistance to the elderly is given priority and is in no way interrupted or delayed, and\n•\t  no additional expense is incurred by the IRS.\nSince the IRS cannot train volunteers to prepare state and local tax returns, grant recipients are \nresponsible for scheduling appropriate state and local tax training, certification of volunteers and for \nsecuring necessary tax forms wherever this service will be voluntarily offered.\nAs a program coordinator you need to ensure that volunteers are aware that they should not solicit or \naccept donations for their tax counseling and return preparation services and they adhere to the ten \nQuality Site Requirements (see later in this publication for more information) to ensure taxpayers visiting \nTCE sites receive quality service and accurate return preparation.\nVolunteers are not to refer a client to a specific paid preparer if the volunteer assistor is unable to help the \ntaxpayer. To prevent the endorsement of a particular paid preparer, the assistor may provide a list of local \nAssurances and Certifications\n16\npaid preparers to a client if the individual requires the assistance of a professional. In addition, volunteers \nperform other relevant duties necessary to comply with the program requirements, program regulations, \nthe Cooperative Agreement, and Section 163 of the Revenue Act of 1978. Any health, accident, and \nliability insurance for volunteers are the grant recipient’s responsibility exclusively.\nReasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities (volunteers/taxpayers) should be provided by \nTCE grant recipients in cooperation with the IRS as noted under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973.The TCE and VITA programs are two separate programs with a different targeted audience and \ncongressional intent for the program. Separate reports and records need to be kept to ensure that TCE \ngrant funds are being expended solely for the purpose of assisting elderly taxpayers. For volunteers that \nserve in a dual capacity (volunteering for both programs), volunteer reimbursement expenses need to \nbe appropriately allocated and separated between the two programs. The TCE site(s) must be clearly \ndesignated as TCE and publicized for service to the elderly. For more information on operating both a \nTCE and a VITA site, please contact the local IRS SPEC Territory Manager.\nAs a TCE grantee, you are expected to provide effective site management for your volunteers. \nCoordinators are also responsible for managing, organizing, and supervising all aspects of site \noperations. How you organize and manage your volunteers is vital to the success of the Tax Counseling \nfor the Elderly (TCE) Programs and is critical to quality tax return preparation services in your community.\n1.\t Recruitment\nSince you will be evaluated on your ability to efficiently serve elderly taxpayers while providing high quality \nassistance, selective recruitment of volunteers should be an important objective. In recruiting volunteers, \nyou should consider the need for the following type of volunteers:\n•\t Tax Assistors/Quality Reviewers\n•\t Tax Instructors\n•\t Coordinators/Administrators\n•\t Screener (certified and non-certified)\n•\t Recruitment/publicity specialist\nPosition Descriptions for key volunteer positions can be found in Publication 5683, VITA/TCE Handbook \nfor Partners and Site Coordinators. Publication 5683 can be found on www.irs.gov. In recruiting \nvolunteers for various positions please keep in mind some of the responsibilities that may be involved with \nparticular positions when selecting an individual. For example:\n•\t \u0007Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators are to provide administrative support for the program by \nacting as managers, program leaders, and publicity specialists, and by providing other services as \nneeded.\n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators who do NOT provide tax assistance to taxpayers do NOT \nneed to receive tax law certification from the IRS.\n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators must complete Site Coordinator Training and certification.\n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators must agree to respect the confidentiality of any information \nprovided by the taxpayer and return information obtained as a result of or in connection with \nvolunteer service.\n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators are needed to manage the activities of volunteers and to \nprovide administrative support for the program.\n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators also may recruit volunteers and establish assistance sites; \ncoordinate training and tax assistance schedules; assist with program publicity; maintain records \nand prepare reports for the IRS and the grant recipient; attend meetings at the IRS and conduct \nliaison work with the IRS; perform related clerical and secretarial duties; and perform other activities \nidentified by the grant recipient as agreed to in the Cooperative Agreement.\n•\t Training specialist\n•\t Equipment procurement coordinator\n•\t Computer specialist\n•\t Interpreter\n•\t e-file transmitter\nManagement of Volunteers\n17\n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators may sign agreements and certifications such as the Property \nLoan Agreement (on IRS loaned equipment) and the IRS SPEC Annual Property Certification (for \ne-file participation).\n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators must verify that all volunteers are properly certified to work \nat VITA/TCE sites. A process must be created to verify the level of certification for each volunteer. \nEach volunteer must sign Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement - VITA/TCE \nPrograms. All Forms 13615 must be certified (signed and dated) by the coordinator, sponsoring \npartner, instructor, or IRS contact, verifying the volunteer has completed the required Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct Training, including passing the test. The coordinator must also confirm the \nvolunteer’s identity, name and address using government-issued photo identification, and confirm \nthey have a signed and dated Form 13615. This process must be completed before any volunteer is \nallowed to begin work at a VITA/TCE site. \n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators must ensure that all IRS-tax law certified volunteer assistors/\npreparers and quality reviewers are assigned tax returns within their certification and within scope of \nthe VITA/TCE Programs. Volunteers preparing tax returns above their level of certification may not \nbe protected from personal liability for their work under federal law.\n•\t Volunteer Coordinators/Administrators must also review and discuss Volunteer Tax Alerts (VTA), \nQuality Site Requirement Alerts (QSRA), and technical updates with all volunteers during the filing \nseason. As a practice a daily briefing should be held to share information impacting site operations \nwith volunteers working at the site.\nAs a grant recipient, you are responsible for recruiting, developing, and managing a network of volunteers \nto accomplish your program objectives and goals. At a minimum, volunteers must be trained to serve \nas site coordinators, screeners (those that answer tax law questions), and tax return preparers and to \nconduct quality reviews of returns prepared by volunteer return preparers.\nThe IRS SPEC Territory Manager is the point of contact for specific information and training support. Their \ncontact information will be provided to you when your organization is accepted into the TCE Program. The \nIRS will provide train-the-trainer sessions for the TCE grant recipients. The grant recipients will then be \nresponsible for training the volunteers participating in the program.\n2. Volunteer Training, Testing, and Certification\nAll volunteers (coordinators, IRS tax law-certified volunteer preparers, designated or peer-to-peer quality \nreviewers, greeters, client facilitators, interpreters, etc.) are required to annually complete and pass the \nVolunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) certification test. In addition, volunteers must certify adherence \nto the VSC by signing and dating Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement - VITA/TCE \nPrograms, prior to working at a site. By signing and dating Form 13615, all volunteers are agreeing to the \nrequirement to follow the Volunteer Standards of Conduct.\nVolunteers who assign tax returns to preparers or quality reviewers, answer tax law questions, instruct \ntax law classes, prepare or correct tax returns or conduct quality reviews of completed tax returns must \nbe certified in tax law and Intake/Interview and Quality Review. All VITA/TCE instructors must be certified \nat the Advanced level or higher (based on the level of tax topics they teach). All Quality Reviewers must \nbe certified at the Basic level or higher (including the specialty levels) based on the complexity of the tax \nreturns they review. SPEC encourages the Quality Reviewer to be the most experienced person in tax law \napplication. \nSite Coordinators must certify annually by taking Site Coordinator training, and passing the Site \nCoordinator Test. The passing score is 80% or higher. Tax law certification is required for site coordinators \nwho prepare returns, correct rejects, conduct quality review or provide tax law assistance. Certification \nlevel is based on the complexity of the return prepared.\nVolunteer training and certification is a critical component of the program. During the training process \nvolunteers learn screening and interviewing techniques, gain an understanding of tax law and how it applies \nin each taxpayer’s situation and the ability to use the tools available to prepare and file accurate tax returns.\nManagement of Volunteers\n18\nAll volunteers must register and certify via Link & Learn Taxes.  Link & Learn Taxes is self-paced \ne-learning for the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (VITA/TCE) \nprogram. This training will instruct volunteers in the VITA/TCE return preparation process and tax law \ncovered in the VITA/TCE program.\nVITA/TCE Courses and Specialty Certifications\nEach course is summarized below.\n•\t Volunteer Standards of Conduct: All new and returning volunteers must complete the Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct (VSC) Training.

This course requires no prerequisites.\n•\t Federal Tax Law Update Test for Circular 230 Professionals: This course certifies VITA/TCE \nvolunteers with the professional designation of attorney, Certified Public Accountant and Enrolled \nAgent, on new provisions and tax law changes. Volunteers with the Federal Tax Law Update Test for \nCircular 230 Professionals certification can prepare, or quality review all returns within the scope of \nthe VITA/TCE Program. Volunteers may choose the Federal Tax Law Update Test for Circular 230 \nProfessionals test or the traditional certification path. SPEC partners may have other certification \nrequirements; \nLink & Learn Taxes is available 24/7 for training and certification beginning in early November.\nManagement of Volunteers\n19\nAs a grant recipient, you are responsible for selecting, establishing, and managing tax assistance sites. \nThe primary considerations you should use in choosing sites should be the existence of a large elderly \npopulation; the accessibility to this population; the location (consider locations where other TCE sites \ndo not exist); and the availability of volunteers in that area. You must comply with the requirements of",

This approving official can be the coordinator, sponsoring partner official, instructor, \nor IRS contact. as appoint Form 13615 must be signed by all volunteers regardless of the certification \nrequirement before assisting at a site.\nPartners are no longer required to maintain Forms 13615 once the volunteer and partner have: Signed \nthe completed agreement; Accurately transferred all required data to the current Form 13206, Volunteer \nAssistance Summary Report, or partner created listing (containing the same information); and forward the \nForm 13206, or partner created listing, to the Territory office. \nPartners can choose to give Forms 13615 back to their volunteers. However, if volunteers are requesting \nContinuing Education (CE) Credits, the form must be completed and forwarded to the SPEC Territory as \ndescribed in CE Credits Requirements. \nAll partners/site coordinators are required to provide their local IRS SPEC Territory Office a list of all \nvolunteers working at VITA/TCE sites, including their certified volunteers, the dates that the volunteers \nreceived certification, and their level of training. The preferred document for reporting the list of volunteers \nis Form 13206, Volunteer Assistance Summary Report. A partner created list containing the same \ninformation is also acceptable. Site coordinators have a responsibility to complete and send a list \nof any volunteers to their local IRS SPEC Territory offices by February 3rd but no later than \nFebruary 15th. A new report must continue to be submitted on the 3rd of each month to show new \nvolunteers not previously reported. The actual certifications can be maintained at the site or partner \nlevel. Form 13206 lists volunteers who have taken the training and received certification, and each \nvolunteer’s certification level. The Form 13206  or Partner created listing should include volunteer names, \nposition, and level of certification. It must also indicate that each volunteer has completed the VSC \ncertification and signed the Form 13615 agreeing to adhere to the VSC. It must also include a statement \ncertifying that all volunteers have signed Form 13615, all volunteer identities, names and addresses, were \nvalidated using government-issued photo ID, volunteer certification was verified, and all Forms 13615 \nwere signed and dated by the partner’s approving official. The partner’s approving official, as designated \nby the partner, may be the coordinator, sponsoring partner, instructor, or IRS contact. \nFor the most current information on volunteer training, testing and certifications, please also refer to:\n•\t Publication 5683, VITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators\n1. Site Establishment\nYou should choose sites where there will be little or no charge for use of space. Libraries, community \ncenters, and schools are excellent examples of space that can be obtained at little or no cost to you. In \ninstances where there is a charge for use of space, refer to the Management of Funds section of this \nhandbook. The availability of a telephone for use by volunteers to obtain technical assistance from the \nSite Management\n20\nIRS should be considered in your site selection. In addition, the availability of parking for your volunteers \nshould be considered when selecting a site.\nDue to IRS SPEC Territory Office no later than January 15\nYou should establish sites and provide the IRS SPEC Territory Office with a list of site addresses and \nhours/days of assistance as soon as this information is known, but no later than January 15th. Form \n13715, Volunteer Site Information Sheet, can be used for this purpose. Form 13715 can be found on \nwww.irs.gov. TCE grant recipients should provide this list immediately to the IRS SPEC Territory Office \nand throughout the filing season when revisions have been made to the site addresses and hours/days of \nassistance. The grant recipient is responsible for establishing a quality control process to regularly monitor \nthe validity of their site information to ensure accurate information is reflected. The IRS toll-free telephone \nassistors must have access to the most current information in order to provide accurate site location \ninformation to taxpayer. You must indicate on the above list which sites, if any, have telephone answering \nfacilities and indicate the telephone number on the list. You must also notate what type of services are \noffered at the site (for example; electronic filing, site prepares prior year returns, languages offered). \nAgain, any changes to this information should be reported to the IRS SPEC Territory Office immediately.\n2. Site Supplies\nForms and publications may be ordered via Form 2333V, Volunteer Order Form, which is available from \nthe local IRS SPEC Territory Manager.\n•\t Standard supplies needed may include, but are not limited to: pens, paper, pencils, staplers, \ncalculators, scissors, tape, paper clips, mailing envelopes, printer cartridges and other supplies that \nmay be used by volunteers at a site. Standard supplies cannot be ordered using Form 2333V.\n•\t  \u0007Publication 5683, VITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators, includes information \nrelated to major program components, hyperlinks to forms and publications you may need and a \ndescription of their use.\n3. Site Records\nAs a grant recipient you should maintain site records of the types of assistance provided to taxpayers. \nThe type of assistance that needs to be captured includes, but not limited to is:\n•\t Number of individual Federal tax returns prepared (paper)\n•\t Number of individual Federal tax returns prepared (e-file)\n•\t Number of taxpayers assisted - all others (excludes return preparation)\nIn addition, each volunteer is responsible for completing reimbursement vouchers as directed by you, \nthe grant recipient. These vouchers should show their allowable expenses incurred in the program. The \ntypes of assistance information and the completed vouchers will then be consolidated and the data will be \nincorporated into the Form 8654, TCE Semi-Annual/Annual Program Report, submitted to the TCE Grant \nProgram Office and when requesting financial payments through the Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS). See Semi-Annual/Annual Report Requirements \nsection for more information on these reports.\nPublication 5683, VITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators provides guidelines to ensure \nthat all sites operate in a consistent manner and includes steps to managing a model site, including special \nsections on quality tax preparation, service and site operation. This publication should be referenced.\n4. E-filing of Returns\nA valuable community service is performed when organizations and agencies band together to ensure all \neligible taxpayers are aware of and take advantage of available free income tax assistance and electronic \nfiling. E-filing of returns has many benefits for the taxpayer including; faster processing of the return, \na greater accuracy rate, less correspondence with the IRS because of increased accuracy, and faster \nrefunds compared to paper filers. It is the intention that all grant recipient organizations electronically file \nall eligible returns. It is a goal for the TCE program that grant recipients electronically file at least sixty five \npercent of all returns completed for taxpayers aged 60+. If an organization does not meet the sixty-five \nSite Management\n21\npercent elderly e-file goal, it will impact their consideration for a TCE grant during the subsequent year \ngrant application period.\nYou may be able to use your organization’s existing computer equipment depending on whether it is \ncompatible with the requirements of the tax preparation software. Although IRS provides a small quantity \nof laptops and printers for use at existing sites, new and current grant recipients are encouraged to \ninclude funding for computers and printers as a budgeted item in the grant proposal when community \nresources are not available.\nIRS provides tax preparation software for its tax preparation sites free of charge. It is an expectation that \ngrant recipients utilize this software for their TCE e-file program. Monies from the grant cannot be used to \npurchase tax preparation software. Three products are available – desktop, online and self-preparation. \nDesktop software orders can only be placed for sites with connectivity issues. Only sites with \nconnectivity issues (e.g., rural areas with unreliable Wi-Fi and cell coverage) will be allowed to order \nTY2024 and beyond Desktop product.\nAdvantages of this product include:\n•\t  \u0007No installation on individual computers – Program maintained on the software provider’s server. \nDesktop users must install software on their own computers.\n•\t  \u0007No updates required – Program is updated by the software provider. Desktop users must download \nand update all computers. Failure to timely install updates may result in the rejection of returns.\n•\t  \u0007No need to backup and restore returns to a central computer for transmission – Data is already at \nthe software provider’s server. Desktop users must download and restore returns to their central \ncomputer designated for transmission since only one computer per site may transmit returns.\n•\t Remote access to troubleshoot problems – The software provider is able to access users’ computers \nremotely to assist in resolving problems. This remote access allows them to see what the user sees. \nThis connectivity is not available in the desktop version.\n•\t  \u0007Improved security\n\t\n– \u0007No data stored on individual computers. Data is securely stored at the software provider’s \nsecured facility. Desktop users store data on individual computers.\n\t\n– The software provider uses software to reduce threat of hackers and detect intrusion attempts. \nDesktop users don’t always have this additional layer of protection.\n\t\n•\t \u0007Access from any computer with proper identification and broadband Internet - Product is immediately \navailable for use. Desktop product must be installed.\n\t\n•\t \u0007Improved design – Easier access overall to tools used for return completion. Accessing some tools in \ndesktop require more steps.\nThere are a number of important resources available to you regarding electronic filing information \nat volunteer sites. They include Publication 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS e-file Providers of \nIndividual Income Tax Returns, and Publication 3112, IRS e-file Application and Participation. These \ndocuments can be found on IRS’ website www.irs.gov along with other important IRS e-file information.\n\t a)\t \u0007Securing an Electronic Filing Identification Number (EFIN)\nTo obtain an EFIN for your site, visit www.irs.gov and type in “e-services” in the key word search \nfield. To assist in completing the online application for an EFIN contact your local SPEC Relationship \nManager.  A separate EFIN must be requested for each physical location. Once your application is \napproved, you will be assigned an EFIN which will enable your site to e-file tax returns.\n\t b)\t License Agreement\n\t\n\t \u0007The license agreement between IRS and the software provider is a “site” license agreement. A site \nis defined as a physical location for purposes of the software license. Each site must have its own \nunique EFIN. A separate license must be acquired for each site at which the software will be used.\nSite Management\n22\nAdditional Conditions to License Agreement\n•\t \u0007The license agreement allows for software to be used from one physical location (EFIN).\t\n•\t \u0007For desktop users, only one computer per EFIN may transmit. (Note: If the transmitting computer \nbreaks, it may be replaced with another computer.) Some examples are:\n\t\n– A military base is considered one physical location even if they have multiple tax centers on the \nbase.\n\t\n– An Indian Reservation with multiple tax sites is required to have a separate license for each tax \nsite.\n\t\n– A college or university campus is considered one physical location; however, separate campuses \nor satellite campuses of the college or university require a separate software license.\n\t\n– A separate software license for each physical location accessing the software from a Local Area \nNetwork (LAN) is required.\n•\t \u0007Site Coordinators/Transmission Coordinators (or other designees) may load the software on \ntheir individual personal computer for the purpose of transmitting returns for a location without a \nphone, modem, or internet connection. Remember - Desktop users may only use one computer for \ntransmission. Note: Grant funds can be used to pay for Internet connectivity costs.\n•\t \u0007Any site meeting one of the exceptions provided below that use laptop computer(s) and transmission \nis centrally done from one computer, a single software license is required.\n•\t \u0007The duplication of the installation CD to facilitate installation on multiple computers is permitted.\n\t c)\t Facilitated Self Assistance Model\nTraditionally TCE provides return preparation services one-on-one to those that visit the site. SPEC has \nan additional model where sites offered expanded services using computer kiosks. Research shows that \naccess to computers and fast Internet connections are barriers to taxpayers filing their own returns and \nindicate that an estimated 16 million additional taxpayers would use free help if it were readily available.\nTCE sites offer a tremendous opportunity to fill the gap. Sites can assist more taxpayers by helping them \nprepare and file their own returns. Sites provide computers and Internet along with a certified volunteer \nto answer questions as taxpayers prepare their own returns. Software is available through the Free File \nAlliance and other software providers for federal and state return preparation. Incorporation of the model \ninto existing services benefits both the sites and the taxpayers.\nTax Site Benefits\nTaxpayer Benefits\n• Prepare and e-file more tax returns\n • \u0007Access to online tax software\n• Allows sites to more fully leverage their volunteers\n • \u0007Assistance from volunteers as needed\n• Target taxpayers who need one-on-one help\n • \u0007Increased knowledge of how tax laws \nimpact individual returns\n• Reduce lines at peak times\n • \u0007Reduced wait time for tax preparation\n• Increase options for taxpayers\n • \u0007Expanded free tax help options\n• Receive credit for returns filed\n • \u0007Builds confidence to file without assistance\nFunds from the TCE Grant can be used to support this model as long as these conditions are met.\n\t\n– Taxpayer prepares and electronically files his or her own return;\n\t\n– Certified volunteer is present to assist if questions arise;\n\t\n– Software used is available free of charge for use in preparing federal and state returns;\n\t\n– Computers and Internet connection provided at the site;\n\t\n– Software allows capture of Site Identification Number; and\n\t\n– \u0007Site operations do not commingle returns prepared using the traditional TCE model with the \ncomputer kiosk TCE model.\nConsider adding this to your portfolio of services for the filing season.\nSite Management\n23\n5. Quality Site Requirements for Tax Assistance\nA measure of the effectiveness of program operations is the quality of service provided to the elderly. \nGiven the complexity of the Federal tax laws, it is important to monitor the accuracy and completeness of \ninformation being provided. All volunteers have the responsibility to provide quality service and to uphold \nethical standards. Volunteer Standards of Conduct have been developed and are included as part of the \nvolunteer certification process.\nThe IRS identified ten practices to ensure taxpayers visiting volunteer sites receive quality service and \naccurate return preparation. These ten practices are called Quality Site Requirements (QSR). Each \ntaxpayer using the services offered through the TCE program should be confident they are receiving \naccurate return preparation and quality service. The Quality Site Requirements are designed to ensure \nconsistent operational processes so that our mutual objectives are met in providing accurate return \npreparation and quality service. All volunteer tax preparation sites in the TCE program must adhere to \nthese requirements:\n•\t QSR - 1 – Certification. New volunteers must take the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) \nTraining. SPEC encourages returning volunteers to review the VSC training as a refresher. Annually, \nall TCE volunteers must pass the VSC certification test with a score of 80% or higher prior to working \nat a site. The training and certification test are available on Link & Learn Taxes and in Publication \n4961, VITA/TCE Volunteer Standards of Conduct - Ethics Training.\nAll new and returning volunteer instructors, preparers, coordinators, and quality reviewers must \nreview Publication 5101, VITA/TCE Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training. Annually, all \nvolunteer instructors, preparers, coordinators, and quality reviewers must pass the Intake/Interview \nand Quality Review certification test. Volunteer greeters, screeners and client facilitators who assign \ntax returns to preparers or assist taxpayers with completing Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review Sheet, must also take this training and certify.\nVolunteers who answer tax law questions, instruct tax law classes, prepare, or correct tax returns, \nand/or conduct quality reviews of completed tax returns must certify in tax law prior to conducting \ntax law related tasks. Tax law certification is an annual requirement. Volunteers who do not help with \ntax law related issues (for example, greeters, receptionists, equipment coordinators, etc.) are not \nrequired to certify in tax law but must still complete the VSC certification test. \nAll coordinators and alternate coordinators must review Publication 5088, VITA/TCE Site \nCoordinator Training. Site coordinator training is an annual requirement. All coordinators and \nalternate coordinators must pass the Site Coordinator Test certification with a score of 80% or higher \nprior to performing any site coordinator duties. \nVolunteers may complete their training by classroom, self-study, or Link & Learn Taxes. Refer \nto Publication 5683, VITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators, for a complete \nillustration of the certification process.\nAARP Foundation Tax-Aide uses the information from SPEC’s training materials to create their \nown training materials for both Site Coordinator training and Intake/Interview and Quality Review \nTraining. They provide all required training for volunteers who instruct, prepare and quality review \ntax returns. In addition to being covered during their face-to-face training sessions, all volunteers \nreceive appropriate training materials by email and are asked to review those materials again prior to \nreporting to their sites.\n•\t QSR - 2 –  Intake/Interview and Quality Review Process. All sites must use Form 13614-C, \nIntake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, for every tax return prepared by an IRS tax law certified \nvolunteer. Form 13614-C guides the IRS-tax law certified volunteer preparer through the interview with \nthe taxpayer and allows them to gather all necessary information for correct return preparation. The \nvolunteer quality reviewer uses the completed tax return, the taxpayer’s supporting documentation and \nthe completed Form 13614-C, to verify the tax return is free from error. Volunteers must also verify that \nSite Management\n24\nthe tax return is within the scope of the VITA/TCE Programs and the volunteer’s certification level. If the \nreturn is out-of-scope for VITA/TCE, the return cannot be prepared by a volunteer at the VITA/TCE site. \nThe taxpayer may need to obtain the assistance of a professional preparer. Volunteers should avoid \nreferring taxpayers to any particular paid preparer.  \nQuality Review – Every site should ensure that a complete quality review process is used to confirm \nthat tax law was correctly applied, and the tax return is free from error, based on the taxpayer \ninterview and the available supporting documents. The quality reviewers should be experienced IRS \ntax law-certified volunteers. TCE sites conduct reviews by a designated reviewer or a peer-to-peer \nreviewer, as self-review is not an approved method.  \n•\t \u0007QSR - 3 – Confirming Photo Identification and Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN). \nCoordinators must have a process in place to confirm taxpayers’ identities and Taxpayer \nIdentification Numbers (TIN). All volunteers must follow verification procedures prior to tax return \npreparation and before a taxpayer signs a TCE prepared tax return and receives a copy of the \nreturn. This process must include using acceptable documents to confirm taxpayers’ identities and \nTIN by reviewing:\n\t\n– Photo identification (ID) for taxpayer (and spouse, if married filing jointly) and\n\t\n– Social Security Numbers (SSN) and Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) for \neveryone listed on the tax return \n•\t \u0007QSR - 4 – Reference Materials.  All sites must have, in paper or electronic form, the following \nreference materials available for use by IRS-certified volunteers:\n\t\n– Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax (for Individuals)\n\t\n– Publication 4012, VITA/TCE Volunteer Resource Guide\n\t\n– Publication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Civil Rights – A Public Trust\n\t\n– Volunteer Tax Alerts (VTA) and Quality Site Requirement Alerts (QSRA) or CyberTax Alerts \nissued by Tax-Aide\n\u0007Publications 17, 4012, and 4299 are available for download on IRS.gov, or by opening the VITA/TCE \nPublications and User Guides option on the navigation bar when signed into TaxSlayer. VTA and \nQSRA are available on the Site Coordinator Corner on IRS.gov. CyberTax Alerts are available on the \nAARP Foundation Tax-Aide website.\n•\t \u0007QSR - 5 – Volunteer Agreement. Annually all volunteers (coordinators, return preparers, quality \nreviewers, greeters, screeners, client facilitators, etc.) must complete the Volunteer Standards of \nConduct (VSC) certification. This includes signing and dating Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of \nConduct Agreement –VITA/TCE Programs, agreeing to follow the VSC. \nThe partner’s approving official must also certify Form 13615 (sign and date). This confirms that the \npartner’s approving official has verified the volunteer’s identity, name and address, the volunteer \nhas completed the required IRS training certification test(s), and the volunteer has signed and dated \nForm 13615. The approving official must validate volunteers’ identities using government-issued \nphoto identification (ID), when reviewing and signing Forms 13615.\n•\t QSR - 6 – Timely Filing, All coordinators must have a process in place to ensure every tax return is \ntimely electronically filed or delivered to the taxpayer. For e-filed tax returns, Form 8879, IRS e-file \nSignature Authorization, is required to be signed by the taxpayer (and spouce if married filing jointly), \nwhich gives the site permission to e-file their tax return. Actions required to guarantee tax returns are \nfiled timely include:\n\t\n– Ensuring that tax returns are submitted to IRS within three calendar days after the site has all \nnecessary information to e-file the tax return.\n\t\n– Retrieving acknowledgements timely (preferably within 48 hours of transmission).\n\t\n– Promptly working rejects that can be corrected by the IRS tax law certified volunteer.\n\t\n– Timely notifying taxpayers (attempted within 24 hours) if rejects cannot be corrected.\nSite Management\n25\n\t\n– For filing paper returns, providing the taxpayer with a completed tax return along with the correct \nmailing address for the processing center for paper tax returns.\n\t\n– Promptly notifying taxpayers if any other problems are identified with tax return processing.\n•\t QSR - 7 – Civil Rights. As advised by our Program Support area --  QSR #7. Civil rights isn’t a \nprohibited word, but the  references have been pulled for review -- pending.\n•\t QSR - 8 – Correct Site Identification Number (SIDN). It is critical that the correct Site Identification \nNumber (SIDN) is included on ALL returns prepared by VITA/TCE sites. E-file administrators set tax \nsoftware defaults to ensure the correct SIDN automatically appears on each tax return.\n•\t \u0007QSR - 9 – Correct Electronic Filing Identification Number (EFIN). The correct Electronic Filing \nIdentification Number (EFIN) is required to be used on every tax return prepared. All applicants must \nuse the online IRS e-file application process located in E-Services to apply for an EFIN or update an \napplication. A separate EFIN is required for each physical location. E-file administrators set the tax \nsoftware defaults to ensure the correct EFIN automatically appears on Form 8879, IRS e-file Authorization.\nQSR - 10 – Security. Sites must follow all security, privacy, and confidentiality guidelines as outlined \nin Publication 4299, Title change for Pub. 4299?. A copy (paper or electronic) of this publication \nmust be available at every site and used when referring to security, privacy, confidentiality, and civil \nrights issues. Publication 4299 is the resource document for providing guidance on securing and \nprotecting personally identifiable information (PII) shared by taxpayers, volunteers, and partners.\nAll coordinators must have security procedures in place as described in Publication 4299 for the \nfollowing processes:\n\t\n– Preparing an annual security plan to safeguard taxpayer data. (Sites can use Form 15272, \nVITA/TCE Security Plan, or a similar document that captures the same information.) \n\t\n– Protecting all computers with passwords.\n\t\n– Using a hard-wired internet connection or encrypted and password-protected all wireless \ninternet connections.\n\t\n– Securing computers, printers, and all equipment after site operating hours.\n\t\n– Safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) at the site by safely storing and/or properly \ndisposing of the information.\n\t\n– Securing IRC Section 7126 consent notices as required.\n\t\n– Limiting volunteer access privileges to the tax software based on assigned roles.\n\t\n– Restricting volunteer access to the tax software after operating hours.\n\t\n– Deactivating usernames in the tax software when volunteers quit, resign, or are no longer \nworking at the site.\nTo help prevent identity theft at TCE sites, IRS-certified volunteers must identify themselves to \nthe taxpayers they assist. Volunteers at in-person sites must wear or display name identification, \nincluding work identification badges, IRS name badges, and Tax-Aide name badges. At a minimum, \nthis identification must include the full first name and first letter of the volunteer’s last name. Form \n14509, VITA/TCE Volunteer ID Insert, is an optional product developed for volunteers to display their \nnames and can be obtained by contacting the territory office. Virtual sites can use electronic means \nto provide the volunteer’s name to the taxpayers.\nWhere to locate information \nThe Quality Site Requirements can be found in the following locations:\n•\t Publication 5683, VITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators\n•\t Publication 5166, VITA/TCE Volunteer Quality Site Requirements\n•\t www.irs.gov - Key word search: Quality Site Requirements\nSite Management\n26\n6. Publicity\nYou are responsible for developing a publicity plan for publicizing your TCE Program and site information \nbut also to recruit volunteers for your program. It should publicize the TCE Program and ensure that the \ntargeted audience is emphasized as the elderly (taxpayers age 60 years or older). Plans for publicity \nshould be made well in advance of the dates assistance is to be offered. All publicity must mention that \ntax assistance is offered FREE of charge to those taxpayers 60 years of age of older. See Publication \n5683, VITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators, for more information on publicity and \nmarketing; including draft copies of news releases that you can utilize for recruiting volunteers or \nadvertising site availability. Publication 5683 can be found on www.irs.gov.\n1. Financial Reporting Requirements\nOnce a grant is awarded, and all appropriate documents are signed by the IRS Director, Stakeholder \nPartnerships, Education and Communication (SPEC), Taxpayer Services Division, and the responsible \nofficial for the grant recipient organization, a request will be sent to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Payment Management Services to establish electronic access to funds. This process \ngenerally takes 3-4 weeks.\na.\t\u0007You must maintain advances of federal grant funds in accounts of a bank with Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage and the balance exceeding the FDIC \ncoverage must be collaterally secured.  Accounts must also bear interest unless:\ni.\t you receive less than $250,000.00 in federal awards per year; or\nSite Management\n27\nii.\t \u0007the best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in \nexcess of $500.00 per year on federal cash balances; or\niii.\t\u0007the depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that an interest-bearing \naccount would not be feasible, given the grant recipient’s expected federal and nonfederal cash \nresources.\na.\t\u0007You may retain up to $500 in interest earned each year for administrative expense. Any \nadditional interest earned on Federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing \naccounts must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services \nPayment Management System (PMS).\nb.\t\u0007Any changes to the above procedures must be approved in writing by the IRS Grant Program \nOffice.\nc.\t\u0007No more than 30 percent of the grant funds awarded may be expended for administrative \nexpenses. All proposed administrative costs must be shown on the appropriate lines of Form \n8653, TCE Program Application Plan.\nd.\tUnexpended grant amounts must be returned to the Internal Revenue Service. (Refer \nto Publication 4883, Grant Programs Resource Guide, for more information). Improper \nexpenditure of grant funds will result in a debt to the federal government and the federal \ngovernment is generally obligated to charge interest on any amount not repaid timely. See 31 \nCFR 901.9.\ne.\t\u0007During the grant cycle, you are required to submit Semi-Annual/Annual and Final Narrative \nreports to give us specific information about the methods and procedures used to implement \nyour program. Refer to Semi-Annual/Annual Report Requirements section of this publication \nfor more information.\nThe expenses shown under the Allowable/Unallowable Expenses section \nof this publication are allowable costs provided they are ordinary and necessary and, in total, \ndo not exceed the amount of the total award specified in the Cooperative Agreement. Changes \nto the budget activities between categories may be made without pre-approval when a change \nis 10% or less of the total award. Approval of changes greater than 10% must be requested \nin advance in writing and approval received before the change may be made. The maximum \naward amount does not change.\nf.\t\u0007Withdrawals. An application may be withdrawn at any time during the application process \nor prior to the time the grant money is awarded. If an accepted grant recipient finds it \nnecessary to withdraw from the TCE Program, the grant recipient organization must return any \nunexpended monies to the IRS in 15 days and submit a letter of withdrawal from the program. \nALL WITHDRAWALS MUST BE MADE IN WRITING.\n2. Allowable/Unallowable Expenses\nFederal funds may be used for expenses or costs that would not have been incurred but for the TCE \nprogram. Expenses are only allowable if they are reasonable expenses or costs. Reimbursement should \nbe for direct, reasonable and prudent expenses incurred as part of volunteer service or as part of the \ngrant recipient’s overhead according to guidelines stated in the Cooperative Agreement. Indirect cost \nexpenditures are not allowable.\nGrant funds may be used to reimburse volunteers for out-of-pocket expenses including transportation, \nmeals and other expenses incurred by them in providing tax counseling assistance at locations \nconvenient to the taxpayers. In addition to volunteer out-of-pocket expenses, funds may be used by the \ngrant recipient organization for salaries, wages, and benefits of personnel that provide administrative or \ndatabase support; or technical personnel responsible for providing support for electronic filing for the TCE \nprogram, (i.e. maintenance of equipment). The salaries, wages and benefits of these individuals may be \npaid under the grant for any time period that they spend their time working on TCE. \nReimbursements may be made to volunteers for actual expenses incurred or stipends provided to \nvolunteers. Either method is permitted and both stipends and actual reimbursements can be used by a \nEvaluation Process\n28\ngrant recipient simultaneously as long as records are kept on both and the total is reported. Please note: \nStipends must be designated on the expected out-of-pocket expenses, rather than the time engaged in \nvolunteer service.\nIn order for stipends to be an allowable expense, the grant recipient must have a written stipend policy \nin place and must provide the stipends in accordance with this policy.  While a grant recipient may \nprovide both stipends and reimbursements for actual expenses, the grant recipient may not provide \nboth a reimbursement of actual costs and a stipend in lieu of reimbursement for the same expense.  \nFor example, if a volunteer receives a stipend to cover the estimated costs of traveling to the site, the \nvolunteer may not also receive reimbursement for the actual cost incurred traveling to the site. \nIn addition, office or site supplies that are needed to aid the volunteers or taxpayers during tax assistance \nare allowable expenditures using grant funds, as well as; printing and postage costs; installation of \ntelephone lines necessary for offering electronic filing and/or to service a telephone answering site; \nInternet connectivity charges to facilitate offering efile services, rent, utilities, and custodial services when  \nnecessary; and costs for interpreter services. Organizations may include the cost of food provided for \nvolunteers at TCE sites.

Publication 4883, Grant Programs Resource Guide\nFor more information on the requirements of the program \nafter the grant is awarded see Publication 4883, Grant \nPrograms Resource Guide, which can be downloaded from \nour TCE website at:https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-\nvita-and-tce-grants. This resource guide was developed \nto provide guidance to recipients of the TCE and/or VITA \nGrant Programs. The TCE and VITA grant programs \nare administered by the Grant Program Office within \ntheTaxpayer Services Division, Stakeholder Partnerships, \nEducation, and Communication (SPEC) organization. \nThis resource guide supplements information provided in Publication 1101, Application Package and \nGuidelines for Managing a TCE Program, and Publication 4671, Helping You Help Others VITA Grant \nProgram Overview and Application Instructions. It should be used as a reference tool for all TCE and VITA \ngrant recipients and by prospective applicants when directed to do so as a resource in understanding the \nrequirements of the two grant programs.\n3. What Happens if I’m Not Awarded\nThe IRS will email a letter explaining that your organization was not awarded a grant and provide \ngeneral information on why it was not selected. The TCE Program is categorized as a discretionary \ngrant program, therefore the necessity for renegotiation, suspension, or termination of a Cooperative \nAgreement will be determined solely by the Internal Revenue Service and will not be subject to appeal.\nA Cooperative Agreement remains in effect for one fiscal year. Even if a multi-year grant is awarded, \na new cooperative agreement would be enacted for Year 2 and 3 of the grant period. The Cooperative \nAgreement expires annually on September 30 unless a the grant recipient organization withdraws from \nthe TCE Program or the IRS terminates the Cooperative Agreement. Cooperative Agreements and its \nassociated terms and conditions within Publication 5245, Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Terms \nand Conditions, include:\n1.\tthe roles and responsibilities to be performed by the IRS, and by the grant recipient,\n2.\tthe maximum amount of the award available to the grant recipient,\n3.\tthe services and return preparation goal to be provided and\n4.\t\u0007other requirements as specified in the application package, Publication 1101.\nThe requirements of Section 163 of the Revenue Act of 1978 shall be considered to be incorporated into \nall Cooperative Agreements between the IRS and grant recipient organizations. Sixty-five percent of tax \nreturn preparation assistance should be provided to elderly taxpayers during the usual period for filing \nFederal income tax returns, which is from January 1 to April 15 each year. However, the program activities \nrequired to ensure that elderly taxpayers receive efficient and quality tax assistance can be conducted \nyear-round.\nNOTE: A Cooperative Agreement period may change if the grant recipient withdraws from the TCE \nProgram or if the IRS terminates the grant recipient’s cooperative agreement. The necessity for \nrenegotiation, suspension, or termination of a Cooperative Agreement will be determined solely by the \nInternal Revenue Service and will not be subject to appeal.\nNotification of Award Decisions\n39",

Interested applicants may download the application \npackage from Grants.gov beginning May 1 regardless of whether Grants.gov registration is complete; however, the \napplication may not be submitted until Grants.gov registration is complete. On the Grants.gov website, locate “Apply \nfor Grants.” Follow the instructions to download the application using the Assistance Listing Number 21.006 or Funding \nOpportunity Number (Funding Opportunity #) TCE-2025.\n1. How to Apply for Grants: Getting Started\n•\t Learn Go to the Grants Learning Center for an overview of grants.\n•\t Check Make sure you are eligible before applying.\n•\t Search Find federal grants that align with your work.\n•\t Register Sign up with Grants.gov to apply using Workspace.\n•\t Apply Complete and submit your application using Workspace.\n•\t Track Enter your Grants.gov tracking number(s) for submission status.\n2. Check Your Eligibility\nBefore beginning the application process, you should make sure you or your organization is eligible to apply for the grant. \nThere are two keys to eligibility:\n\t\na) Registering to apply through Grants.gov\n\t\nb) Understanding legal eligibility per the funding opportunity\nWhere do you find this information?\nHere’s a link to the Get Registered section. For the full legal eligibility requirements, you need to carefully read the Application \nInstructions that are attached to every funding opportunity in Grants.gov. The awarding agencies define eligibility in those instructions, \nand they may also summarize the eligibility in the Synopsis Details section.\nWondering who comes up with the eligibility?\nCheck out the Grant Eligibility section of Learn Grants for details on how eligibility is defined and what types of funding \nyou or your organization can generally apply for.\n3. Registering an Organization \nThe instructions below are for new organizations or organizations that have never applied for a federal grant before. Most \napplicants work for organizations that already completed these steps to do business with the federal government.\n53",

    "text": "Appendix B - TCE Application Forms & Aids\nExhibit 5: Using Grants.gov - Application Submission and Receipt Procedures (continued)\nBefore your organization can apply for a federal grant, there are several steps an organization must complete \noutside of Grants.gov prior to submitting an application through Grants.gov. An organization is an entity that \nsubmits grant applications on behalf of the group, such as a state government, nonprofit organization or a private \nbusiness. Once you form a legal entity with a Employer Identification Number (EIN), you are ready to complete \nthe steps below.\nBelow are the main steps and links to more information to complete this process. The process below can take \nbetween three business days and five weeks, so please make sure to begin early. If you do not complete these \nsteps by the submission deadline, you are unlikely to be allowed to submit an application. Contact the federal \nagency point of contact listed in the grant opportunity to discuss that agency’s policy.\na) Register with SAM        \nHow do I register with the System Award Management (SAM)?\nAccess www.sam.gov and complete the online registration process. \nThe SAM.gov is a government-wide registry for organizations doing business with the Federal \ngovernment. SAM.gov centralizes information about grant recipients and provides a central location \nfor grant recipients to change organizational information. Grants.gov uses SAM.gov to establish \norganizational authority for its users and to provide unique entity identification numbers. SAM \nregistration must be renewed annually. \nFirst, you must register with SAM.gov to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI). The UEI is a \n12-character alphanumeric identifier assigned to all entities (public and private companies, \nindividuals, institutions, or organizations) to do business with the Federal Government. \nOrganizations will also need to designate an E-Business Point of Contact (EBiz POC). It can \ntake 7-10 business days to fully complete the registration process required for most funding \nopportunities. There is no fee for registering with SAM.gov.\n→  How long does this step usually take?\n     Up to 2 weeks.   \nb) Register with Grants.gov        \nHow do I register a Grants.gov account?\nClick the HYPERLINK above \nAfter obtaining the UEI for the organization from SAM.gov, you must return to Grants.gov to \ncontinue registration. There is no fee for registering with Grants.gov. Your organization’s\nEBiz POC must:\n1) Create a Grants.gov account with the same email address as used in SAM.gov for EBiz POC, \nand \n54\n2) Add a profile with Grants.gov using the UEI obtained from SAM.gov.\nThe EBiz POC can then delegate administrative roles to other users. https://apply07.grants.\ngov/help/html/help/index.htm?callingApp=custom#callingApp=custom&t=Applicants%\n2FManagement%2FManageRolesForApplicant.htm for instructions. \n→  How long does this step usually take?\nSame day   \nc) Applicant FAQs. NOTE: Passwords expire every 60 days. Accounts inactive for 1 year or more \nresult in removal of all account roles. For more account management information, review the \nApplicant FAQs.  \nd) Electronic Signature: When applications are submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the \norganization applicant with the AOR role that submitted the application is inserted into the signature \nline of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The EBiz POC must authorize people who \nare able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as a user with the AOR \nrole; this step is often missed and it is crucial for valid and timely submissions.\n4. How to Submit an Application to IRS via Grants.gov\nGrants.gov applicants can apply online using Workspace. Workspace is a shared, online environment where members \nof a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different webforms within an application. For each funding \nopportunity announcement (FOA), you can create individual instances of a workspace.\nBelow is an overview of applying on Grants.gov. For access to complete instructions on how to apply for opportunities, \nrefer to: www.grants.gov/applicants/grant-applications/how-to-apply-for-grants\n1) Create a Workspace: Creating a workspace allows you to complete it online and route it through your \norganization for review before submitting.",

Grants.gov recommends submitting your \napplication package at least 24-48 hours prior to the close date to provide you with time to correct any potential \ntechnical issues that may disrupt the application submission.\n4) Track a Workspace Submission: After successfully submitting a workspace application, a Grants.gov Tracking \nNumber (GRANTXXXXXXXX) is automatically assigned to the application. The number will be listed on the \nConfirmation page that is generated after submission.
