This document outlines our guiding principles, strategic \npriorities, recent achievements, and the efforts currently underway to \ndrive progress. The Whistleblower Office is responsible for adminis­\ntering claims for award filed by whistleblowers that identify taxpayers \nwho may not be fully compliant with tax laws or other laws the IRS is \nauthorized to administer, enforce, or investigate. \nOur Operating Plan is an integrated approach to advance the IRS \nWhistleblower Program and incorporates extensive feedback received \nfrom whistleblowers, whistleblower practitioners, IRS leaders and \nemployees, oversight bodies, and other program stakeholders. The \nplan considers and integrates fundamental concepts around risk \nmanagement, data management, metrics, information systems, \nclaim processes, training, communication, stakeholder relationships, \nemployee needs, and whistleblower laws and regulations. It includes \nboth short-term operational planning and longer-term planning for the \nfuture of the program.\nThe Value of an Effective IRS Whistleblower Program\nOur nation’s tax system is built on the principle of voluntary compliance. \nWhen this principle is observed, taxpayers file tax returns and pay \ntheir taxes timely and accurately. Voluntary compliance is aided by the \nknowledge that non-compliance with tax laws will be addressed through \nexaminations, collection activities, criminal investigations, and other tax \ncompliance work. The IRS uses increasingly sophisticated data analytics \nand other methods to detect non-compliance with tax laws, but we \ncan’t find it all by ourselves. We need help from whistleblowers – people \nwith firsthand knowledge of non-compliance who are willing to share \nwhat they know with us so we can investigate it when warranted.\nSince 2007, the Whistleblower Office has made awards of over $1.3 \nbillion based on the collection of more than $7.4 billion attributable to \nwhistleblower information. The IRS appreciates the valuable assistance \nit has received from whistleblowers and the tremendous support the \nwhistleblower practitioner community provides to the Whistleblower \nProgram. Whistleblower information that the IRS can act on is an \nimportant component of effective tax administration as it bolsters the \nfair, efficient, and effective enforcement of our nation’s tax laws, the \nsuccess of our voluntary tax system, and our efforts to reduce the \ntax gap. In addition to the proceeds collected attributable directly to \nwhistleblower information, an effective whistleblower program also \nprovides an invaluable deterrence against non-compliance with tax laws.  \nContinuous Improvement\nThe IRS is committed to continuous improvement of the IRS \nWhistleblower Program with a heavy focus on using high-value \nwhistleblower information effectively, awarding whistleblowers fairly \nand as soon as possible, and keeping whistleblowers informed of their \nclaims’ status and the basis for IRS decisions on claims. Whistleblower \ninformation has high value when it is specific, timely, credible, relevant, \nand significant.\nWe look forward to collaborating with Whistleblower Program \nstakeholders as we continue building on the foundation of our success.\nSincerely,\nJohn W. Hinman\nDirector, Whistleblower Office \nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR\n2\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\nIRS Whistleblower Office Vision\nTo effectively promote voluntary compliance and reduce the tax gap by \nproviding excellent service to whistleblowers, taxpayers, and other\nstakeholders.\nWhistleblower Program Background\nAmerica’s first whistleblower law was passed by the\nContinental Congress on July 30, 1778. The first law \nrelated to whistleblowers on tax violations was \nenacted in March 1867. Congress mandated the \ncreation of the IRS Whistleblower Office in Section \n406 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of \n2006 to administer the IRS Whistleblower \nProgram. The Whistleblower Office analyzes \ninformation submitted by whistleblowers, \nmonitors the contribution made by \nwhistleblowers, and makes deter­\nminations on whistleblower \nclaims for award.\nIRS Whistleblower Office Mission\nTo effectively administer the IRS Whistleblower \nProgram by ensuring:\n \nX IRS compliance functions receive and consider \nspecific, timely, and credible whistleblower claims \nthat identify non-compliance with tax laws or other \nlaws the IRS is authorized to administer, enforce, or \ninvestigate;\n \nX Whistleblowers receive required notifications timely; and \n \nX Awards are fairly determined and timely paid.\nMISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS FOR A \nMISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS FOR A \nTRANSFORMED WHISTLEBLOWER PROGRAM\nTRANSFORMED WHISTLEBLOWER PROGRAM\nThe IRS Whistleblower Office’s mission and vision statements guide the direction and future of the Whistleblower \nProgram. As the first part of enhancing the Whistleblower Program, we prepared new mission and vision \nstatements to ensure our responsibilities and goals are clear and concise. \n3\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\nMission and Core Strategy\nWe will align our actions with the mission, vision, and strategic goals of the IRS and the \nWhistleblower Office. We are committed to continuous improvement of the IRS Whistleblower \nProgram. We will promote a culture that supports whistleblowers, and we will work to raise \nawareness of the Whistleblower Program. We will prioritize effective communication, internal \ncontrols, and risk management.\nIRS Employees\nIRS Whistleblower Office employees and the many other employees who support the program are the key to our success. Their \ndedication, expertise, and collaborative efforts make them essential to accomplishing our mission and goals. We will recognize \nemployees for outstanding contributions to the program. We will ensure they are supported with the right tools, training, coaching, \nand networking. We will engage with employees to seek their input for improvement and feedback on proposed changes.\nKnowledge Management\nWe will foster a culture of knowledge sharing across the organization by leveraging broad insights and expertise through training, \nonline resources, networking, and cross-function collaboration. We will update and maintain the Internal Revenue Manual and \nprocedure guides to ensure information is current and consistent. We will ensure Whistleblower Program information on\nIRS.gov is helpful and accurate.\nData, Systems, and Processes\nWe will emphasize the importance of capturing relevant data accurately and protecting it. We will continually improve data analytics \ncapabilities and enhance internal measures and metrics dashboards to drive informed decisions and improved performance.\nWe will support a robust risk management process and evaluate risk management strategies. We will ensure compliance\nwith our internal controls and quality assurance processes. We will identify new opportunities to pay award claims sooner.\nWhistleblower Program Stakeholders\nWe recognize and value the numerous stakeholders of the IRS Whistleblower Program. We will partner with stakeholders \nto strengthen collaboration and to seek frequent input and feedback. We are committed to providing excellent service \nto whistleblowers, whistleblower practitioners, taxpayers, IRS compliance functions, and all other stakeholders. We’ll \nconsider other governmental whistleblower program practices in our efforts to continuously improve the program.\nLaw and Regulations\nWe recognize that whistleblower laws and regulations are the foundation of our program. We will \nemphasize and adhere to the statutory obligations and agency policies to maintain the confidentiality of \nboth whistleblower information and taxpayer information. We will collaborate regularly and effectively with \nthe Office of Chief Counsel on legal matters and explore the potential for updating whistleblower-related \nregulations and for suggesting changes to whistleblower-related laws. We will remain fully compliant with \nannual withholding tax return filing requirements.\nWHISTLEBLOWER \nOFFICE\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES\nThe IRS Whistleblower Office’s \nguiding principles serve as the \nfoundation for the success of the \nIRS Whistleblower Program. \nThey define elements of our \nmission, vision, and ongoing/\ncontinuous priorities.  \nIRS\n4\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\nFRAMEWORK OF STRATEGIC PRIORITIES\nFRAMEWORK OF STRATEGIC PRIORITIES\nThe IRS Whistleblower Office Operating Plan is framed around six strategic priorities:\nWithin these six strategic priorities, we have selected 38 initiatives to focus our efforts on. Some of the initiatives will require discrete, \nspecific activities to complete while other initiatives are broad. Our intention is to ensure the plan identifies areas of significant importance \nwhile allowing flexibility to address other concerns that may have multiple aspects. \nKEY THEMES\nKEY THEMES\nEnsure that our workforce \nis supported with effective \ntools, technology, training, \nand other resources.\nEnhance the claim submission \nprocess to promote greater \nefficiency.\nUse high-value \nwhistleblower information \neffectively.\nAward whistleblowers fairly \nand as soon as possible.\nKeep whistleblowers \ninformed of the status of \ntheir claims and the basis \nfor IRS decisions on claims.\nSafeguard whistleblower \nand taxpayer information.\nDATA AND \nINFORMATION\nCapturing better data, \nimproving analytics, and \nensuring both whistleblower \nand taxpayer information is \neffectively protected.\nEnsuring that we have the \nright resources supported \nwith effective tools, \ntechnology, and training.\nSTAFFING\nSYSTEMS AND \nPROCESSES\nIdentifying improvements to \nclaim management systems, \nclaim filing, initial claim \nanalysis, claim determinations, \nand claim status processes.\nIncreasing collaboration with IRS \ncompliance functions, with the Office of \nChief Counsel, with whistleblower practi­\ntioners, and with other stakeholders to \ncontinuously improve the program.\nCOLLABORATION\n5\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\nCRITICAL STEPS & BENEFITS\nCRITICAL STEPS & BENEFITS\nCRITICAL STEPS\nBENEFITS\nWORKFORCE ALIGNMENT\nImprove and align staffing to meet core mission workload, \naccomplish improvement goals, and take on new challenges.\nMODERNIZING CLAIM \nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nImportant data on alleged non-compliance issues and other \nclaim factors will be captured. Data analytic capabilities \nwill improve access to digital data and enhance operational \ndecision-making.\nESTABLISHING ON-LINE \nCLAIM SUBMISSION PORTAL\nMove from an inefficient paper-based claim process into a \ndigital-based process with increased access to critical data.\nSTREAMLINING AND \nAUTOMATING PROCESSES\nStreamline and automate processes to improve efficiencies, \ndecrease claim processing times, and improve services to \ninternal and external stakeholders.\nIMPROVING INITIAL CLAIM \nANALYSIS PROCESS\nEfficiently identify and prioritize high-value whistleblower \nclaims. Capture critical data on compliance issues.\n6\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\n \nX In September 2024, the Whistleblower Office implemented a new \norganizational structure. Organizational changes included transfer­\nring-in the Initial Claim Evaluation team from the Small Business/\nSelf-Employed Division (SB/SE) and expanding from two to three \nWhistleblower Office functions. \n \nX During Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, we hired 36 additional employees (a \n75% increase) with a focus on whistleblower claim processing, notifi­\ncations to whistleblowers, and data analytics.  \n \nX In March 2024, we updated and improved the Form 211 (Application \nfor Award for Original Information). Improvements include reorga­\nnizing the form with a more logical flow, the addition of expandable \ndata fields, an updated list of alleged violations issues to select \nfrom, a new option for multiple whistleblowers to file jointly, and we \nupdated the form’s instructions including the addition of QR codes \nfor quick access to Whistleblower Program information.  \n \nX In FY 2024, we revised the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) and \nwhistleblower procedure guides. A key IRM update was to provide \nclarifications around factors for disaggregations (a process that \nallows for earlier award payments by separating certain completed \nactions). We also updated the IRM to provide guidance on Freedom \nof Information Act (FOIA) requests to strengthen controls over and \nprotection of whistleblower records. We continue reviewing policy \nand procedures for opportunities to improve program effectiveness \nand claim processing efficiencies.\n \nX We have continued efforts to disaggregate claims to pay awards \nsooner and we took steps in FY 2024 to improve Taxpayer First Act \nwhistleblower notices and letters. \n \nX We are developing an online digital intake portal for whistleblower \nclaims to make it easier to submit information and request an award. \nWe are working with other IRS functions and contractors to build \nand implement the system.\n \nX We added more locations across the U.S. to offer whistleblowers \nadditional options for the Administrative Claim File Review process.\n \nX We are developing a new approach for the initial analysis of \nwhistleblower claims to help ensure high-value submissions are \nbetter identified and prioritized. \n \nX We are working with contractors and other IRS functions to design \nand implement a new whistleblower claim inventory management \nsystem that will improve program efficiencies and data analytics.  \n \nX We developed new internal measures and metrics reporting as part \nof our effort to enhance program performance.  \n \nX We established a process to ensure the Annual Report to Congress \nis submitted for clearance by December 31st each year.\nACHIEVEMENTS AND EFFORTS UNDERWAY\nACHIEVEMENTS AND EFFORTS UNDERWAY\nWe’ve already made significant progress toward realizing goals of the plan, and remain committed to investing in our employees, \nenhancing data and systems, and improving processes to better serve our stakeholders. We haven’t waited to finalize our plan before \ntaking robust action to make progress on our goals.  \nRecent achievements and significant efforts underway by the Whistleblower Office include:\n7\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\n \nX In March 2024, we updated and improved the Form 11369 (Confi­\ndential Evaluation Report on Claim for Award). The updates improve \nour ability to evaluate the contributions made by whistleblowers in \nactions taken by the IRS. \n \nX We increased outreach and collaboration across IRS programs and \nbusiness units, with the Office of Chief Counsel, other governmental \nwhistleblower programs, the external whistleblower practitioner \ncommunity, and with others.\n \nX We continue to invest in our talented and dedicated employees \nthrough technical training, leadership training, employee develop­\nmental opportunities, and improved tools.  \nACHIEVEMENTS AND EFFORTS UNDERWAY \nACHIEVEMENTS AND EFFORTS UNDERWAY (CONTINUED)\n(CONTINUED)\n \nX We made updates to program information on IRS.gov to improve \ncontent and are continuing these efforts.\n \nX Using new data analytics techniques with our existing whistleblower \nclaim management system, we have identified claims for additional \nreview to determine if the claim can be moved to the next processing \nstep and closer to determination and award payment, when appropriate.\n \nX We worked closely with Chief Counsel attorneys and submitted \na request to be included in the 2024-2025 Treasury Department \nPriority Guidance Plan (PGP). The request was accepted, and a \nproject to update the regulations under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)",

This section provides information on \nthe initiatives and target priority efforts for 2025 through 2027.\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITY 1\nENHANCE THE CLAIM SUBMISSION PROCESS TO PROMOTE GREATER \nENHANCE THE CLAIM SUBMISSION PROCESS TO PROMOTE GREATER \nEFFICIENCY\nEFFICIENCY\nThe Whistleblower Office will adjust staffing and resources to effectively \ncarry out its mission and meet evolving needs. We have significantly \nincreased our engagement with IRS compliance functions, and \nthe IRS’s new Chief Tax Compliance Officer (CTCO) organizational \nstructure further re-enforces those efforts. We will work closely with IRS \ncompliance functions to align efforts on priority compliance issues. The \nWhistleblower Office is evaluating current whistleblower claim intake, \nanalysis, and classification processes and is working on improvements \nthat will help ensure high-value submissions are identified and prioritized. \nWe will improve claim processing efficiencies, expand digitalization, and \nmove away from a paper-based system toward a new digital records \napproach. We are working on making it easier for whistleblowers to file \na claim by developing a digital intake portal. In FY 2024, we made key \nrevisions to the Form 211 (Application for Award for Original Information) \nto provide future digital processing, and we updated IRS policy to \nremove the Form 211 “wet-ink” signature requirement. We will work \nto increase program awareness that the IRS Whistleblower Program \ncovers both non-compliance with tax laws as well as other laws the IRS \nis authorized to administer, enforce, or investigate. \n2025 Priority Efforts\n2026 – 2027 Priority Efforts\n1.1 \n1.1  Adjust staffing resources \nwhere needed\n1.2 \n1.2  Create an online digital \nintake portal for the Form 211 \n(Application for Award for \nOriginal Information)\n1.3 \n1.3  Improve intake, analysis, \nand classification processes\n1.4 \n1.4  Expand digitalization\n1.5 \n1.5  Efficiently deal with repeat \nfilers of speculative claims\n1.6 \n1.6  Improve content and \nfunctionality on the Whistleblower \nOffice’s IRS.gov page\n1.7 \n1.7  Create focused, issue-\nspecific outreach\n1.8 \n1.8  Review award payment \nthresholds\n1.9 \n1.9  Explore opportunities to \nexpand whistleblower claim \nprocessing in languages other \nthan English\n9\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\nThe Whistleblower Office is fully supporting IRS transformation \nefforts. We will continue close coordination with business units \nacross the IRS, and collaboration efforts with whistleblower practi­\ntioners and other whistleblower programs. The Whistleblower Office \nwill work to align claim priorities with the IRS’s portfolio of strategic \nenforcement priorities. In FY 2024, we revised the Form 211 to allow \nfor improved identification of claim factors, added an option for multiple \nwhistleblowers to submit a claim jointly, and improved the form’s \ninstructions. We continue efforts to increase data capture and improve \nanalytics by procuring a replacement for our whistleblower claim \ninventory management system.\nIn September 2024, the Whistleblower Office implemented a new \norganizational structure. Organizational changes included transferring-in \nthe Initial Claim Evaluation team from the Small Business/Self-Employed \nDivision (SB/SE), expansion from two to three Whistleblower Office \nfunctions, the addition of additional claim administration teams, and a \nnew team that will focus on initial claim analysis.\nThe Whistleblower Office will continue its efforts to collaborate regularly \nwith Chief Counsel attorneys throughout the IRS, including attorneys who \nsupport field compliance efforts and litigation, Procedure and Adminis­\ntration attorneys, and General Legal Services attorneys. We will continue \nour efforts to work closely with whistleblowers, when appropriate, using \nthe authority provided by IRC Sections 6103(n) and 6103(k)(13)(A). We will \ncontinue our collaboration with other whistleblower programs to share \nand consider information on best practices.\n2025 Priority Efforts\n2026 – 2027 Priority Efforts\n2.1 \n2.1  Improve initial analysis \neffectiveness\n2.2 \n2.2  Improve the whistleblower \nclaim management system\n2.3 \n2.3  Ensure skill sets are aligned \nto program needs\n2.4 \n2.4  Increase efforts to work \nmore closely with whistleblowers \nusing the most appropriate \napproach\n2.5 \n2.5  Collaborate on and consider \nefficiencies around other types of \nIRS information submissions\n2.6 \n2.6  Re-emphasize debriefings \nof whistleblowers\n2.7 \n2.7  Consider best practices of \nother whistleblower programs\n2.8 \n2.8  Watch for opportunities to \nidentify tax compliance topics \nwhere strengthened information \nand service delivery could \nbenefit taxpayers\n2.9 \n2.9  Evaluate taint review \nprocedures and risk \nassessments associated with \nwhistleblower information\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITY 2\nUSE HIGH-VALUE WHISTLEBLOWER INFORMATION EFFECTIVELY\nUSE HIGH-VALUE WHISTLEBLOWER INFORMATION EFFECTIVELY\n10\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\nThe Whistleblower Office will continue evaluating whistleblower claim \nprocesses, policies, procedures, and published products to help \nensure whistleblower claims are fairly considered and awarded as \nsoon as the law and resources permit. We will continue reviewing \nthe Whistleblower Office “risk appetite” to move toward an approach \nthat carefully analyzes the level of risk, available risk mitigations, \nand potential benefits/gains. In FY 2024, we revised the Form 11369 \nto improve data capture for the evaluation of how whistleblower \ninformation was used. On October 3, 2024, the Treasury Department \nreleased the 2024-2025 Priority Guidance Plan. Included in the plan is \na project related to the regulations under IRC Section 7623 regarding \nawards to whistleblowers. The Whistleblower Office will work closely \nwith Chief Counsel attorneys on this effort.   \nThe IRS pays awards from proceeds collected and as such, award \npayments can only be made once the taxpayer has exhausted all appeal \nrights, and the taxpayer no longer can file a claim for refund or otherwise \nseek to recover the proceeds from the government. Although the time \nit takes from when the Whistleblower Office receives a Form 211 claim \nsubmission to paying an award is mostly related to investigations, \ntaxpayer appeals and litigation, and collection efforts, we will continue \nefforts to act expeditiously on processes that we control. In FY 2024, we \nupdated the IRM to provide clarifications around factors for disaggrega­\ntions. We will continue to apply these IRM provisions to make disaggre­\ngated award payments when appropriate. In addition to disaggrega­\ntions, we will explore other potential opportunities to pay awards sooner. \nWe will use new data analytic approaches to identify any backlogs \nwhere claims could be moved to the next claim processing stage. \nWhere backlogs are identified, we will create a plan to address and \neliminate such backlogs. We will be prepared to implement legislative \nor judicial changes, including, for example, if a provision is enacted \nthat provides for the potential payment of interest on awards. We will \ncontinue to explore opportunities to more efficiently determine and pay \nawards for cases with multiple whistleblower award claims.\n2025 Priority Efforts\n2026 – 2027 Priority Efforts\n3.1 \n3.1  Be prepared to implement \nlegislative or judicial changes\n3.2 \n3.2  Review procedures for \nidentifying the final determination \nof tax\n3.3 \n3.3  Identify opportunities \nto more efficiently determine \nawards for cases with multiple \nwhistleblowers\n3.4 \n3.4  Review procedures for \nreconsideration requests\n3.5 \n3.5  Update program Delegation \nOrders\n3.6 \n3.6  Consider opportunities to \nobtain input on whistleblower \ncontributions earlier\n3.7 \n3.7  Better define policies and \nprocedures for claim cases with \ncomplex tax attributes\n3.8 \n3.8  Review procedures to \nimprove efficiencies with Tax \nCourt remands\n3.9 \n3.9  Explore the potential need \nfor additional flexibilities to pay \nawards under the discretionary \nprovisions of IRC Section 7623(a)\n3.10 \n3.10  Explore opportunities to \nemphasize collection efforts \non cases involving proceeds \nattributable to a whistleblower\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITY 3\nAWARD WHISTLEBLOWERS FAIRLY AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\nAWARD WHISTLEBLOWERS FAIRLY AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\n11\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\nThe Whistleblower Office will continue to invest in services for \nwhistleblowers and representatives through improved communica­\ntions and information contained in notices and will continue efforts to \nimprove whistleblower “referred for audit”, “collection”, and “status and \nstage” TFA notification processes. In FY 2024, we established a 90-day \ntarget timeframe to respond to written status and stage claim requests. \nWe will work with the Office of Chief Counsel to improve the adminis­\ntrative claim review process and standardize procedures for redactions \nof taxpayer information.\n2025 Priority Efforts\n2026 – 2027 Priority Efforts\n4.1 \n4.1  Continue to improve \nTaxpayer First Act (TFA) notice \nprocesses\n4.2 \n4.2  Expand options for \nAdministrative Claim File Reviews\n4.3 \n4.3  Work with Counsel \nto standardize redaction \nprocedures\n4.4 \n4.4  Consider improvements to \n“status and stage” notifications, \nprocesses, and procedures\n4.5 \n4.5  Consider potential \nimprovements to Detailed Award \nRecommendation Letter (DARL) \nprocedures\n4.6 \n4.6  Consider potential for \nregulatory change to allow \nimproved disclosures with \nregard to IRC Section 7623(a) \nclaim denials\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITY 4\nKEEP WHISTLEBLOWERS INFORMED OF THE STATUS OF THEIR CLAIMS AND \nKEEP WHISTLEBLOWERS INFORMED OF THE STATUS OF THEIR CLAIMS AND \nTHE BASIS FOR IRS DECISIONS ON CLAIMS\nTHE BASIS FOR IRS DECISIONS ON CLAIMS\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITY 5\nSAFEGUARD WHISTLEBLOWER AND TAXPAYER INFORMATION\nSAFEGUARD WHISTLEBLOWER AND TAXPAYER INFORMATION\nSafeguarding whistleblower and taxpayer information is an utmost \npriority for the IRS. The Whistleblower Office will continue emphasizing \nthe importance of confidentiality, security, and privacy of both \nwhistleblower information and taxpayer information. In FY 2024, we \nrevised the Internal Revenue Manual and added guidance for Freedom \nof Information Act (FOIA) request procedures to strengthen controls \nover and protection of whistleblower records. In FY 2024, we added \ncontent and information on the revised Form 211 and the Whistleblower \nOffice’s IRS.gov page to raise awareness on potential restrictions for \nwhistleblowers who are considered taxpayer representatives. We will \nalso continue our efforts to reduce the risk of inadvertent improper \ndisclosure of whistleblower information.\n2025 Priority Efforts\n2026 – 2027 Priority Efforts\n5.1 \n5.1  Enhance the protection \nof whistleblower and taxpayer \ninformation\n5.2 \n5.2  Strengthen processes \nrelated to privileged information\n12\b\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE OPERATING PLAN\nThe Whistleblower Office is fortunate to have dedicated, \nknowledgeable, and experienced staff who are committed to providing \nexcellent service to all program stakeholders. We will drive change by \ncontinuously assessing and monitoring employees’ feedback. We will \nwork to attract, develop, and retain exceptional talent, and ensure our \nworkforce has the tools and training necessary to serve whistleblowers, \nrepresentatives, compliance staff, and other program stakeholders. We \nwill update position descriptions as needed to ensure they accurately \nreflect critical job expectations and responsibilities.\n2025 Priority Efforts\n2026 – 2027 Priority Efforts\n6.1 \n6.1  Review employee and \nmanagement standard position \ndescriptions (PDs) to ensure \nthose align with responsibilities \nand roles\n6.2 \n6.2  Develop and utilize a \nstrategic management model \nthat incorporates strategy, \ndata, systems, & processes, \nthe Whistleblower Office team, \nknowledge management, \nstakeholders, and laws & \nregulations\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITY 6\nENSURE THAT OUR WORKFORCE IS SUPPORTED WITH EFFECTIVE TOOLS, \nENSURE THAT OUR WORKFORCE IS SUPPORTED WITH EFFECTIVE TOOLS, \nTECHNOLOGY, TRAINING, AND OTHER RESOURCES\nTECHNOLOGY, TRAINING, AND OTHER RESOURCES\nPublication 6074 (4-2025)  Catalog Number 95607T  Department of Treasury  Internal Revenue Service  www.irs.gov",
