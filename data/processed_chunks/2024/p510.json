For fed-\neral income tax purposes, reduce your section \n4081 excise tax liability by the amount of excise \ntax credit allowable under section 6426(c) or (e) \nand your section 4041 excise tax liability by the \namount of your excise tax credit allowable un-\nder section 6426(d), in determining your deduc-\ntion for those excise taxes or your cost of goods \nsold deduction attributable to those excise \ntaxes.\nDue to the IRS' acquiescence in a re-\ncent court case, the section 4611 tax \non exported crude oil currently doesn’t \napply. See AOD 2023-01, at IRS.gov/Actions-\non-Decisions.\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs \nAct. Effective July 1, 2022, the Infrastructure \nInvestment and Jobs Act reinstates the section \n4661 excise tax on chemicals (other than \nODCs) (IRS No. 54) and the section 4671 tax \non imported chemical substances (IRS No. 17) \n(they previously expired on December 31, \n1995). See the Instructions for Form 6627, and \nEnvironmental Taxes, later.\nCAUTION\n!\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \nAct) made the following changes. Effective \nJanuary 1, 2023, the Act reinstates and increa-\nses the Hazardous Substance Superfund fi-\nnancing rate (petroleum Superfund tax rate) on \ndomestic crude oil and imported petroleum \nproducts (the taxes previously expired on De-\ncember 31,1995). This makes the total section \n4611 tax rate on domestic crude oil and impor-\nted petroleum products the sum of this reinsta-\nted Hazardous Substance Superfund financing \nrate (petroleum Superfund tax rate) and the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund financing rate (petro-\nleum oil spill tax rate).

Qualified subchapter S \nsubsidiaries (QSubs) and eligible single-owner \ndisregarded entities are treated as separate en-\ntities for excise tax and reporting purposes. \nQSubs and eligible single-owner disregarded \nentities must pay and report excise taxes (other \nthan IRS Nos. 31, 51, and 117); register for \nmost excise tax activities; and claim any re-\nfunds, credits, and payments under the entity's \nemployer identification number (EIN). These ac-\ntions can't take place under the owner's tax-\npayer identification number (TIN). Some QSubs \nand disregarded entities may already have an \nEIN. However, if you're unsure, please call the \nIRS Business and Specialty Tax line at \n800-829-4933.\nGenerally, QSubs and eligible single-owner \ndisregarded entities will continue to be treated \nas disregarded entities for other federal tax pur-\nposes (other than employment taxes).\nFor more information on these regulations, \nsee Treasury Decisions (T.D.) 9356, T.D. 9462, \nand T.D. 9596.

    "text": "Chapter 1 defines the types of fuel, taxable events, and exemptions or \nexceptions to the fuel taxes. Chapter 2 provides information on, and \ndefinitions of, the nontaxable uses and explains how to make a claim.\n1.\nFuel Taxes\nDefinitions\nExcise taxes are imposed on all the following \nfuels.\n•\nGasoline, including aviation gasoline and \ngasoline blendstocks.\n•\nDiesel fuel, including dyed diesel fuel.\n•\nDiesel-water fuel emulsion.\n•\nKerosene, including dyed kerosene and \nkerosene used in aviation.\n•\nOther fuels (including alternative fuels).\n•\nCompressed natural gas (CNG).\n•\nFuels used in commercial transportation on \ninland waterways.\n•\nAny liquid used in a fractional ownership \nprogram aircraft as fuel.\nThe following terms are used throughout the \ndiscussion of fuel taxes. Other terms are de-\nfined in the discussion of the specific fuels to \nwhich they pertain.\nAgri-biodiesel. Agri-biodiesel means biodiesel \nderived solely from virgin oils, including esters \nderived from virgin vegetable oils from corn, \nsoybeans, sunflower seeds, cottonseeds, can-\nola, crambe, rapeseeds, safflowers, flaxseeds, \nrice bran, mustard seeds, and camelina, and \nfrom animal fats.\nApproved terminal or refinery. This is a ter-\nminal operated by a registrant that is a terminal \noperator or a refinery operated by a registrant \nthat is a refiner.\nBiodiesel. Biodiesel means the monoalkyl es-\nters of long chain fatty acids derived from plant \nor animal matter that meet the registration re-\nquirements for fuels and fuel additives estab-\nlished by the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, \nand the requirements of the American Society \nof Testing Materials (ASTM) D6751.\nBlended taxable fuel. This means any taxable \nfuel produced outside the bulk transfer/terminal \nsystem by mixing taxable fuel on which excise \ntax has been imposed and any other liquid on \nwhich excise tax hasn’t been imposed. This \ndoesn't include a mixture removed or sold dur-\ning the calendar quarter if all such mixtures re-\nmoved or sold by the blender contain less than \n400 gallons of a liquid on which the tax hasn’t \nbeen imposed.\nBlender. This is the person that produces blen-\nded taxable fuel.\nBulk transfer. This is the transfer of taxable \nfuel by pipeline or vessel.\nBulk transfer/terminal system.  This is the \ntaxable fuel distribution system consisting of re-\nfineries, pipelines, vessels, and terminals. Fuel \nin the supply tank of any engine, or in any tank \ncar, railcar, trailer, truck, or other equipment \nsuitable for ground transportation isn't in the \nbulk transfer/terminal system.\nDiesel-water fuel emulsion. A diesel-water \nfuel emulsion means an emulsion at least 14% \nof which is water. The emulsion additive used to \nproduce the fuel must be registered by a U.S. \nmanufacturer with the EPA under section 211 of \nthe Clean Air Act as in effect on March 31, \n2003.\nDry lease aircraft exchange. See Surtax on \nAny Liquid Used in a Fractional Ownership Pro-\ngram Aircraft as Fuel, later.\nEnterer. This is the importer of record (under \ncustoms law) for the taxable fuel. However, if \nthe importer of record is acting as an agent, \nsuch as a customs broker, the person for whom \nthe agent is acting is the enterer. If there is no \nimporter of record, the owner at the time of en-\ntry into the United States is the enterer.\nEntry. Taxable fuel is entered into the United \nStates when it's brought into the United States \nand applicable customs law requires that it be \nentered for consumption, use, or warehousing. \nThis doesn't apply to fuel brought into Puerto \nRico (which is part of the U.S. customs terri-\ntory), but does apply to fuel brought into the \nUnited States from Puerto Rico.\nFractional ownership aircraft program and \nfractional program aircraft. See Surtax on \nany liquid used in a fractional ownership pro-\ngram aircraft as fuel, later.\nMeasurement of taxable fuel. Volumes of \ntaxable fuel can be measured on the basis of \nactual volumetric gallons or gallons adjusted to \n60 degrees Fahrenheit.\nOther fuels. See Other Fuels (Including Alter-\nnative Fuels), later.\nPipeline operator. This is the person that op-\nerates a pipeline within the bulk transfer/termi-\nnal system.\nPosition holder. This is the person that holds \nthe inventory position in the taxable fuel in the \nterminal, as reflected in the records of the termi-\nnal operator. You hold the inventory position \nwhen you have a contractual agreement with \nthe terminal operator for the use of the storage \nfacilities and terminaling services for the taxable \nfuel. A terminal operator that owns taxable fuel \nin its terminal is a position holder.\nRack. This is a mechanism capable of deliver-\ning fuel into a means of transport other than a \npipeline or vessel.\nRefiner. This is any person that owns, oper-\nates, or otherwise controls a refinery.\nRefinery. This is a facility used to produce tax-\nable fuel and from which taxable fuel may be re-\nmoved by pipeline, by vessel, or at a rack. How-\never, this term doesn't include a facility where \nonly blended fuel, and no other type of fuel, is \nproduced. For this purpose, blended fuel is any \nmixture that would be blended taxable fuel if \nproduced outside the bulk transfer/terminal sys-\ntem.\nRegistrant. This is a taxable fuel registrant \n(see Registration Requirements, later).\nRemoval. This is any physical transfer of taxa-\nble fuel. It also means any use of taxable fuel \nother than as a material in the production of tax-\nable fuel or other fuels. However, taxable fuel \nisn't removed when it evaporates or is otherwise \nlost or destroyed.\nSale. For taxable fuel not in a terminal, this is \nthe transfer of title to, or substantial incidents of \nownership in, taxable fuel to the buyer for \nmoney, services, or other property. For taxable \nfuel in a terminal, this is the transfer of the in-\nventory position if the transferee becomes the \nposition holder for that taxable fuel.\nSecond generation biofuel. This is any liquid \nfuel derived by, or from, qualified feedstocks, \nand meets the registration requirements for \nfuels and fuel additives established by the EPA \nunder section 211 of the Clean Air Act (42 \nU.S.C. 7545). It also includes certain liquid fuel \nthat is derived by, or from, any cultivated algae, \n4\nChapter 1\nFuel Taxes\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\ncyanobacteria, or lemna. It isn't alcohol of less \nthan 150 proof (disregard any added denatur-\nants). See Form 6478 for more information.\nState. This includes any state, any of its politi-\ncal subdivisions, the District of Columbia, and \nthe American Red Cross. An Indian tribal gov-\nernment is treated as a state only if transactions \ninvolve the exercise of an essential tribal gov-\nernment function.\nTaxable fuel. This means gasoline, diesel fuel, \nand kerosene.\nTerminal. This is a storage and distribution fa-\ncility supplied by pipeline or vessel, and from \nwhich taxable fuel may be removed at a rack. It \ndoesn't include a facility at which gasoline \nblendstocks are used in the manufacture of \nproducts other than finished gasoline if no gas-\noline is removed from the facility. A terminal \ndoesn't include any facility where finished gaso-\nline, diesel fuel, or kerosene is stored if the fa-\ncility is operated by a registrant and all such tax-\nable fuel stored at the facility has been \npreviously taxed upon removal from a refinery \nor terminal.\nTerminal operator. This is any person that \nowns, operates, or otherwise controls a termi-\nnal.\nThroughputter. This is any person that is a po-\nsition holder or that owns taxable fuel within the \nbulk transfer/terminal system (other than in a \nterminal).\nVessel operator. This is the person that oper-\nates a vessel within the bulk transfer/terminal \nsystem. However, vessel doesn't include a \ndeep-draft ocean-going vessel.\nInformation Returns\nForm 720-TO and Form 720-CS are information \nreturns used to report monthly receipts and dis-\nbursements of liquid products. A liquid product \nis any liquid transported into storage at a termi-\nnal or delivered out of a terminal. For a list of \nproducts, see the product code table in the In-\nstructions for Forms 720-TO and 720-CS.\nThe returns are due the last day of the \nmonth following the month in which the transac-\ntion occurs. Generally, these returns can be \nfiled on paper or electronically. For information \non filing electronically, see Publication 3536, \nMotor Fuel Excise Tax EDI Guide. Publication \n3536 is only available on the IRS website.\nForm 720-TO. This information return is used \nby terminal operators to report receipts and dis-\nbursements of all liquid products to and from all \napproved terminals. Each terminal operator \nmust file a separate form for each approved ter-\nminal.\nForm 720-CS. This information return must be \nfiled by bulk transport carriers (barges, vessels, \nand pipelines) who receive liquid product from \nan approved terminal or deliver liquid product to \nan approved terminal.\nRegistration \nRequirements\nThe following discussion applies to excise tax \nregistration requirements for activities relating to \nfuels only. See Form 637 for other persons who \nmust register and for more information about \nregistration.\nPersons that are required to be registered. \nYou're required to be registered if you're a:\n•\nBlender;\n•\nEnterer;\n•\nPipeline operator;\n•\nPosition holder;\n•\nRefiner;\n•\nTerminal operator;\n•\nVessel operator;\n•\nProducer or importer of alcohol, biodiesel, \nagri-biodiesel, and renewable diesel; or\n•\nProducer or importer of sustainable avia-\ntion fuel (SAF);\n•\nProducer of clean transportation fuel which \nis SAF;\n•\nProducer of clean transportation fuel which \nis not SAF; or\n•\nProducer of cellulosic or second genera-\ntion biofuel.\nPersons that may register. You may, but \naren’t required to, register if you're a:\n•\nFeedstock user,\n•\nIndustrial user,\n•\nThroughputter that isn't a position holder,\n•\nUltimate vendor,\n•\nDiesel-water fuel emulsion producer,\n•\nCredit card issuer, or\n•\nAlternative fuel claimant.\nUltimate vendors, credit card issuers, and alter-\nnative fuel claimants don’t need to be registered \nto buy or sell fuel. However, they must be regis-\ntered to file claims for certain sales and uses of \nfuel. See Form 637 for more information.\nTaxable fuel registrant. This is an enterer, an \nindustrial user, a refiner, a terminal operator, or \na throughputter who received a letter of registra-\ntion under the excise tax registration provisions \nand whose registration hasn’t been revoked or \nsuspended. The term “registrant” as used in the \ndiscussions of these fuels means a taxable fuel \nregistrant.\nAdditional information. See the Form 637 \ninstructions for the information you must submit \nwhen you apply for registration.\nFailure to register or reregister. The penalty \nfor failure to register or reregister if you must \nregister or reregister, unless due to reasonable \ncause, is $10,000 for the initial failure, and then \n$1,000 each day thereafter you fail to register or \nreregister.\nGasoline and Aviation \nGasoline\nGasoline. Gasoline means all products com-\nmonly or commercially known or sold as gaso-\nline with an octane rating of 75 or more that are \nsuitable for use as a motor fuel. Gasoline in-\ncludes any gasoline blend other than:\n•\nQualified ethanol and methanol fuel (at \nleast 85% of the blend consists of alcohol \nproduced from coal, including peat);\n•\nPartially exempt ethanol and methanol fuel \n(at least 85% of the blend consists of alco-\nhol produced from natural gas); or\n•\nDenatured alcohol.\nGasoline also includes gasoline blendstocks, \ndiscussed later.\nAviation gasoline. This means all special \ngrades of gasoline suitable for use in aviation \nreciprocating engines and covered by ASTM \nspecification D910 or military specification \nMIL-G-5572.\nTaxable Events\nThe tax on gasoline is $0.184 per gallon. The \ntax on aviation gasoline is $0.194 per gallon. \nWhen used in a fractional ownership program \naircraft, gasoline is also subject to a surtax of \n$0.141 per gallon. See Surtax on Any Liquid \nUsed in a Fractional Ownership Program Air-\ncraft as Fuel, later.\nTax is imposed on the removal, entry, or sale \nof gasoline. Each of these events is discussed \nlater. Also, see the special rules that apply to \nGasoline Blendstocks, later.\nIf the tax is paid on the gasoline in more than \none event, a refund may be allowed for the “sec-\nond” tax paid.

    "text": "chapter 2.\nRemoval from terminal. All removals of gaso-\nline at a terminal rack are taxable. The position \nholder for that gasoline is liable for the tax.\nTwo-party exchanges. In a two-party ex-\nchange, the receiving person, not the delivering \nperson, is liable for the tax imposed on the re-\nmoval of taxable fuel from the terminal at the \nterminal rack. A two-party exchange means a \ntransaction (other than a sale) where the deliv-\nering person and receiving person are both tax-\nable fuel registrants and all of the following ap-\nply.\n•\nThe transaction includes a transfer from \nthe delivering person, who holds the inven-\ntory position for the taxable fuel in the ter-\nminal, as reflected in the records of the ter-\nminal operator.\n•\nThe exchange transaction occurs before or \nat the same time as removal across the \nrack by the receiving person.\n•\nThe terminal operator in its records treats \nthe receiving person as the person that re-\nmoves the product across the terminal rack \nfor purposes of reporting the transaction on \nForm 720-TO.\n•\nThe transaction is subject to a written con-\ntract.\nTerminal operator's liability. The terminal \noperator is jointly and severally liable for the tax \nif the position holder is a person other than the \nterminal operator and isn't a registrant.\nHowever, a terminal operator meeting all the \nfollowing conditions at the time of the removal \nwon’t be liable for the tax.\n•\nThe terminal operator is a registrant.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 1\nFuel Taxes\n5\n•\nThe terminal operator has an unexpired \nnotification certificate (discussed later) \nfrom the position holder.\n•\nThe terminal operator has no reason to be-\nlieve any information on the certificate is \nfalse.\nRemoval from refinery. The removal of gaso-\nline from a refinery is taxable if the removal \nmeets either of the following conditions.\n•\nIt's made by bulk transfer and the refiner, \nthe owner of the gasoline immediately be-\nfore the removal, or the operator of the \npipeline or vessel isn't a registrant.\n•\nIt's made at the refinery rack.\nThe refiner is liable for the tax.\nException. The tax doesn't apply to a re-\nmoval of gasoline at the refinery rack if all the \nfollowing requirements are met.\n•\nThe gasoline is removed from an approved \nrefinery not served by pipeline (other than \nfor receiving crude oil) or vessel.\n•\nThe gasoline is received at a facility oper-\nated by a registrant and located within the \nbulk transfer/terminal system.\n•\nThe removal from the refinery is by railcar.\n•\nThe same person operates the refinery \nand the facility at which the gasoline is re-\nceived.\nEntry into the United States. The entry of \ngasoline into the United States is taxable if the \nentry meets either of the following conditions.\n•\nIt's made by bulk transfer and the enterer \nor the operator of the pipeline or vessel \nisn't a registrant.\n•\nIt isn't made by bulk transfer.\nThe enterer is liable for the tax.\nImporter of record's liability. The im-\nporter of record is jointly and severally liable for \nthe tax with the enterer if the importer of record \nisn't the enterer of the taxable fuel and the en-\nterer isn't a taxable fuel registrant.\nHowever, an importer of record meeting both \nof the following conditions at the time of the en-\ntry won’t be liable for the tax.\n•\nThe importer of record has an unexpired \nnotification certificate (discussed in Cus-\ntoms bond below) from the enterer.\n•\nThe importer of record has no reason to \nbelieve any information in the certificate is \nfalse.\nCustoms bond. The customs bond won’t \nbe charged for the tax imposed on the entry of \nthe gasoline if at the time of entry the surety has \nan unexpired notification certificate from the en-\nterer and has no reason to believe any informa-\ntion in the certificate is false.\nRemoval from a terminal by unregistered \nposition holder or unregistered pipeline or \nvessel operator. The removal by bulk transfer \nof gasoline from a terminal is taxable if the posi-\ntion holder for the gasoline or the operator of \nthe pipeline or vessel isn't a registrant. The po-\nsition holder is liable for the tax. The terminal \noperator is jointly and severally liable for the tax \nif the position holder is a person other than the \nterminal operator.\nBulk transfers not received at approved ter-\nminal or refinery.  Tax is imposed if:\n1. Gasoline is removed by bulk transfer from \na terminal or refinery, or entered by bulk \ntransfer into the United States.\n2. No tax was previously imposed (as dis-\ncussed earlier).\n3. Upon removal from the pipeline or vessel, \nthe gasoline isn't received at an approved \nterminal or refinery (or at another pipeline \nor vessel).\nThe owner of the gasoline when it's removed \nfrom the pipeline or vessel is liable for the tax. \nHowever, an owner meeting all the following \nconditions at the time of the removal won’t be li-\nable for the tax.\n•\nThe owner is a registrant.\n•\nThe owner has an unexpired notification \ncertificate (discussed later) from the opera-\ntor of the terminal or refinery where the \ngasoline is received.\n•\nThe owner has no reason to believe any in-\nformation on the certificate is false.\nThe operator of the facility where the gasoline is \nreceived is liable for the tax if the owner meets \nthese conditions. The operator is jointly and \nseverally liable if the owner doesn't meet these \nconditions.\nSales to unregistered person. The sale of \ngasoline located within the bulk transfer/termi-\nnal system to a person that isn't a registrant is \ntaxable if tax wasn't previously imposed under \nany of the events discussed earlier.\nThe seller is liable for the tax. However, a \nseller meeting all the following conditions at the \ntime of the sale won’t be liable for the tax.\n•\nThe seller is a registrant.\n•\nThe seller has an unexpired notification \ncertificate (discussed later) from the buyer.\n•\nThe seller has no reason to believe any in-\nformation on the certificate is false.\nThe buyer of the gasoline is liable for the tax if \nthe seller meets these conditions.

The \nremoval or sale of blended gasoline by the blen-\nder is taxable. See Blended taxable fuel under \nDefinitions, earlier.\nThe blender is liable for the tax. The tax is \nfigured on the number of gallons not previously \nsubject to the tax on gasoline.\nPersons who blend alcohol with gasoline to \nproduce an alcohol fuel mixture outside the bulk \ntransfer/terminal system must pay the gasoline \ntax on the volume of alcohol in the mixture. See \nForm 720 to report this tax. You must also be \nregistered with the IRS as a blender. See Form \n637.\nHowever, if an untaxed liquid is sold as \ntaxed taxable fuel and that untaxed liquid is \nused to produce blended taxable fuel, the per-\nson that sold the untaxed liquid is jointly and \nseverally liable for the tax imposed on the \nblender's sale or removal of the blended taxable \nfuel.\nNotification certificate. The notification certif-\nicate is used to notify a person of the registra-\ntion status of the registrant. A copy of the regis-\ntrant's letter of registration can't be used as a \nnotification certificate. A model notification cer-\ntificate is shown in the Appendix as Model Cer-\ntificate C. A notification certificate must contain \nall information necessary to complete the \nmodel.\nThe certificate may be included as part of \nany business records normally used for a sale. \nA certificate expires on the earlier of the date \nthe registrant provides a new certificate, or the \ndate the recipient of the certificate is notified \nthat the registrant's registration has been re-\nvoked or suspended. The registrant must pro-\nvide a new certificate if any information on a \ncertificate has changed.\nAdditional persons liable. When the person \nliable for the tax willfully fails to pay the tax, joint \nand several liability for the tax is imposed on:\n•\nAny officer, employee, or agent of the per-\nson who is under a duty to ensure the pay-\nment of the tax and who willfully fails to \nperform that duty; or\n•\nAnyone who willfully causes the person to \nfail to pay the tax.\nGasoline Blendstocks\nGasoline blendstocks may be subject \nto $0.001 per gallon LUST tax as dis-\ncussed below.\nGasoline includes gasoline blendstocks. \nThe previous discussions apply to these blend-\nstocks. However, if certain conditions are met, \nthe removal, entry, or sale of gasoline blend-\nstocks are taxed at $0.001 per gallon or aren’t \nsubject to the excise tax. If these conditions \naren’t met, gasoline blendstocks are generally \ntaxed as gasoline. However, transmix contain-\ning gasoline is taxed as a diesel fuel. See Die-\nsel Fuel and Kerosene, later.\nBlendstocks. Gasoline blendstocks are:\n•\nAlkylate,\n•\nButane,\n•\nButene,\n•\nCatalytically cracked gasoline,\n•\nCoker gasoline,\n•\nEthyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE),\n•\nHexane,\n•\nHydrocrackate,\n•\nIsomerate,\n•\nMethyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE),\n•\nMixed xylene (not including any separated \nisomer of xylene),\n•\nNatural gasoline,\n•\nPentane,\n•\nPentane mixture,\n•\nPolymer gasoline,\nCAUTION\n!\n6\nChapter 1\nFuel Taxes\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\n•\nRaffinate,\n•\nReformate,\n•\nStraight-run gasoline,\n•\nStraight-run naphtha,\n•\nTertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME),\n•\nTertiary butyl alcohol (gasoline grade) \n(TBA),\n•\nThermally cracked gasoline,\n•\nToluene, and\n•\nTransmix containing gasoline.\nHowever, gasoline blendstocks don't include \nany product that can't be used without further \nprocessing in the production of finished gaso-\nline.\nNot used to produce finished gasoline. \nGasoline blendstocks not used to produce fin-\nished gasoline aren’t taxable (other than LUST) \nif the following conditions are met.\nRemovals and entries not connected to \nsale. Nonbulk removals and entries aren’t taxa-\nble if the person otherwise liable for the tax (po-\nsition holder, refiner, or enterer) is a registrant.\nRemovals and entries connected to sale. \nNonbulk removals and entries aren’t taxable if \nthe person otherwise liable for the tax (position \nholder, refiner, or enterer) is a registrant, and at \nthe time of the sale, meets the following require-\nments.\n•\nThe person has an unexpired certificate \nfrom the buyer.\n•\nThe person has no reason to believe any \ninformation in the certificate is false.\nSales after removal or entry. The sale of \na gasoline blendstock that wasn't subject to tax \non its nonbulk removal or entry, as discussed \nearlier, is taxable. The seller is liable for the tax. \nHowever, the sale isn't taxable if, at the time of \nthe sale, the seller meets the following require-\nments.\n•\nThe seller has an unexpired certificate (dis-\ncussed below) from the buyer.\n•\nThe seller has no reason to believe any in-\nformation in the certificate is false.\nCertificate of buyer. The certificate from the \nbuyer certifies the gasoline blendstocks won’t \nbe used to produce finished gasoline. The cer-\ntificate may be included as part of any business \nrecords normally used for a sale. A model certif-\nicate is shown in the Appendix as Model Certifi-\ncate D.

An industrial \nuser is any person that receives gasoline blend-\nstocks by bulk transfer for its own use in the \nmanufacture of any product other than finished \ngasoline.\nCredits or refunds. A credit or refund of the \ngasoline tax may be allowable if gasoline is \nused for a nontaxable purpose or exempt use. \nFor more information, see Fuel Tax Credits and \nRefunds in chapter 2.\nDiesel Fuel and \nKerosene\nGenerally, diesel fuel and kerosene are taxed in \nthe same manner as gasoline (discussed ear-\nlier). However, special rules (discussed under \nAlaska and Feedstocks) apply to dyed diesel \nfuel and dyed kerosene, and to undyed diesel \nfuel and undyed kerosene sold or used in \nAlaska for certain nontaxable uses and undyed \nkerosene used for a feedstock purpose.\nDiesel fuel. Diesel fuel means:\n•\nAny liquid that without further processing \nor blending is suitable for use as a fuel in a \ndiesel-powered highway vehicle or train; or\n•\nTransmix.\nA liquid is suitable for this use if the liquid \nhas practical and commercial fitness for use in \nthe propulsion engine of a diesel-powered high-\nway vehicle or diesel-powered train. A liquid \nmay possess this practical and commercial fit-\nness even though the specified use isn't the \npredominant use of the liquid. However, a liquid \ndoesn't possess this practical and commercial \nfitness solely by reason of its possible or rare \nuse as a fuel in the propulsion engine of a die-\nsel-powered highway vehicle or diesel-powered \ntrain. Diesel fuel doesn't include gasoline, kero-\nsene, excluded liquid, No. 5 and No. 6 fuel oils \ncovered by ASTM specification D396, or F-76 \n(Fuel Naval Distillate) covered by military speci-\nfication MIL-F-16884.\nExcluded liquid. An excluded liquid is either of \nthe following:\n1. A liquid that contains less than 4% normal \nparaffins.\n2. A liquid with all the following properties.\na. Distillation range of 125 degrees Fah-\nrenheit or less.\nb. Sulfur content of 10 ppm or less.\nc. Minimum color of +27 Saybolt.\nTransmix. Transmix means a by-product of \nrefined products created by the mixing of differ-\nent specification products during pipeline trans-\nportation.\nKerosene. This means any of the following liq-\nuids.\n•\nOne of the two grades of kerosene (No. \n1-K and No. 2-K) covered by ASTM specifi-\ncation D3699.\n•\nKerosene-type jet fuel covered by ASTM \nspecification D1655 or military specifica-\ntion MIL-DTL-5624T (Grade JP-5) or \nMIL-DTL-83133E (Grade JP-8). See Kero-\nsene for Use in Aviation, later.\nHowever, kerosene doesn't include excluded \nliquid, discussed earlier.\nKerosene also includes any liquid that would \nbe described above but for the presence of a \ndye of the type used to dye kerosene for a non-\ntaxable use.\nDiesel-powered highway vehicle. This is any \nself-propelled vehicle designed to carry a load \nover public highways (whether or not also de-\nsigned to perform other functions) and propel-\nled by a diesel-powered engine. Specially de-\nsigned mobile machinery for nontransportation \nfunctions and vehicles specially designed for \noff-highway transportation aren’t generally con-\nsidered diesel-powered highway vehicles. For \nmore information about these vehicles and for \ninformation about vehicles not considered high-\nway vehicles, see Off-highway business use \n(No. 2) in chapter 2.\nDiesel-powered train. This is any diesel-pow-\nered equipment or machinery that rides on rails. \nThe term includes a locomotive, work train, \nswitching engine, and track maintenance ma-\nchine.\nTaxable Events\nThe tax on diesel fuel and kerosene is $0.244 \nper gallon. It's imposed on the removal, entry, or \nsale of diesel fuel and kerosene. Each of these \nevents is discussed later. Only the $0.001 LUST \ntax applies to dyed diesel fuel and dyed kero-\nsene, discussed later.\nIf the tax is paid on the diesel fuel or kero-\nsene in more than one event, a refund may be \nallowed for the “second” tax paid. See Refunds \nof Second Tax in chapter 2.\nUse in certain intercity and local buses. \nDyed diesel fuel and dyed kerosene can't be \nused in certain intercity and local buses. A claim \nfor $0.17 per gallon may be made by the regis-\ntered ultimate vendor (under certain conditions) \nor the ultimate purchaser for undyed diesel fuel \nor undyed kerosene sold for use in certain inter-\ncity or local buses. An intercity or local bus is a \nbus engaged in furnishing (for compensation) \npassenger land transportation available to the \ngeneral public. The bus must be engaged in \none of the following activities.\n•\nScheduled transportation along regular \nroutes regardless of the size of the bus.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 1\nFuel Taxes\n7\n•\nNonscheduled transportation if the seating \ncapacity of the bus is at least 20 adults (not \nincluding the driver).\nA bus is available to the general public if the bus \nis available for hire to more than a limited num-\nber of persons, groups, or organizations.\nRemoval from terminal. All removals of diesel \nfuel and kerosene at a terminal rack are taxable. \nThe position holder for that fuel is liable for the \ntax.\nTwo-party exchanges. In a two-party ex-\nchange, the receiving person, not the delivering \nperson, is liable for the tax imposed on the re-\nmoval of taxable fuel from the terminal at the \nterminal rack. A two-party exchange means a \ntransaction (other than a sale) where the deliv-\nering person and receiving person are both tax-\nable fuel registrants and all of the following ap-\nply.\n•\nThe transaction includes a transfer from \nthe delivering person, who holds the inven-\ntory position for the taxable fuel in the ter-\nminal as reflected in the records of the ter-\nminal operator.\n•\nThe exchange transaction occurs before or \nat the same time as completion of removal \nacross the rack by the receiving person.\n•\nThe terminal operator in its records treats \nthe receiving person as the person that re-\nmoves the product across the terminal rack \nfor purposes of reporting the transaction on \nForm 720-TO.\n•\nThe transaction is subject to a written con-\ntract.\nTerminal operator's liability. The terminal \noperator is jointly and severally liable for the tax \nif the terminal operator provides any person with \nany bill of lading, shipping paper, or similar \ndocument indicating that diesel fuel or kerosene \nis dyed, (see Dyed Diesel Fuel and Dyed Kero-\nsene, later).\nThe terminal operator is jointly and severally \nliable for the tax if the position holder is a per-\nson other than the terminal operator and isn't a \nregistrant. However, a terminal operator won’t \nbe liable for the tax in this situation if, at the time \nof the removal, the following conditions are met.\n•\nThe terminal operator is a registrant.\n•\nThe terminal operator has an unexpired \nnotification certificate (discussed under \nGasoline) from the position holder.\n•\nThe terminal operator has no reason to be-\nlieve any information on the certificate is \nfalse.\nRemoval from refinery. The removal of diesel \nfuel or kerosene from a refinery is taxable if the \nremoval meets either of the following condi-\ntions.\n•\nIt's made by bulk transfer and the refiner, \nthe owner of the fuel immediately before \nthe removal, or the operator of the pipeline \nor vessel isn't a registrant.\n•\nIt's made at the refinery rack.\nThe refiner is liable for the tax.\nException. The tax doesn't apply to a re-\nmoval of diesel fuel or kerosene at the refinery \nrack if all the following conditions are met.\n1. The diesel fuel or kerosene is removed \nfrom an approved refinery not served by \npipeline (other than for receiving crude oil) \nor vessel.\n2. The diesel fuel or kerosene is received at a \nfacility operated by a registrant and loca-\nted within the bulk transfer/terminal sys-\ntem.\n3. The removal from the refinery is by:\na. Railcar and the same person operates \nthe refinery and the facility at which \nthe diesel fuel or kerosene is re-\nceived; or\nb. For diesel fuel only, a trailer or semi-\ntrailer used exclusively to transport \nthe diesel fuel from a refinery (descri-\nbed in (1)) to a facility (described in \n(2)) less than 20 miles from the refin-\nery.\nEntry into the United States. The entry of \ndiesel fuel or kerosene into the United States is \ntaxable if the entry meets either of the following \nconditions.\n•\nIt's made by bulk transfer and the enterer \nor the operator of the pipeline or vessel \nisn't a registrant.\n•\nIt isn't made by bulk transfer.\nThe enterer is liable for the tax.\nImporter of record's liability. The im-\nporter of record is jointly and severally liable for \nthe tax with the enterer if the importer of record \nisn't the enterer of the taxable fuel and the en-\nterer isn't a taxable fuel registrant.\nHowever, an importer of record meeting both \nof the following conditions at the time of the en-\ntry won’t be liable for the tax.\n1. The importer of record has an unexpired \nnotification certificate (discussed under \nGasoline) from the enterer.\n2. The importer of record has no reason to \nbelieve any information in the certificate is \nfalse.\nCustoms bond. The customs bond won’t \nbe charged for the tax imposed on the entry of \nthe diesel fuel or kerosene if at the time of entry \nthe surety has an unexpired notification certifi-\ncate from the enterer and has no reason to be-\nlieve any information in the certificate is false.\nRemoval from a terminal by unregistered \nposition holder or unregistered pipeline or \nvessel operator. The removal by bulk transfer \nof diesel fuel or kerosene from a terminal is tax-\nable if the position holder for that fuel or the op-\nerator of the pipeline or vessel isn't a registrant. \nThe position holder is liable for the tax. The ter-\nminal operator is jointly and severally liable for \nthe tax if the position holder is a person other \nthan the terminal operator. See Terminal opera-\ntor's liability under Removal from terminal, ear-\nlier, for an exception.\nBulk transfers not received at approved ter-\nminal or refinery. The removal by bulk transfer \nof diesel fuel or kerosene from a terminal or re-\nfinery or the entry of diesel fuel or kerosene by \nbulk transfer into the United States is taxable if \nthe following conditions apply.\n1. No tax was previously imposed (as dis-\ncussed earlier) on any of the following \nevents.\na. The removal from the refinery.\nb. The entry into the United States.\nc. The removal from a terminal by an un-\nregistered position holder.\n2. Upon removal from the pipeline or vessel, \nthe diesel fuel or kerosene isn't received at \nan approved terminal or refinery (or at an-\nother pipeline or vessel).\nThe owner of the diesel fuel or kerosene \nwhen it's removed from the pipeline or vessel is \nliable for the tax. However, an owner meeting all \nthe following conditions at the time of the re-\nmoval won’t be liable for the tax.\n•\nThe owner is a registrant.\n•\nThe owner has an unexpired notification \ncertificate (discussed under Gasoline) from \nthe operator of the terminal or refinery \nwhere the diesel fuel or kerosene is re-\nceived.\n•\nThe owner has no reason to believe any in-\nformation on the certificate is false.\nThe operator of the facility where the diesel fuel \nor kerosene is received is liable for the tax if the \nowner meets these conditions. The operator is \njointly and severally liable if the owner doesn't \nmeet these conditions.\nSales to unregistered person. The sale of \ndiesel fuel or kerosene located within the bulk \ntransfer/terminal system to a person that isn't a \nregistrant is taxable if tax wasn't previously im-\nposed under any of the events discussed ear-\nlier.\nThe seller is liable for the tax. However, a \nseller meeting all the following conditions at the \ntime of the sale won’t be liable for the tax.\n•\nThe seller is a registrant.\n•\nThe seller has an unexpired notification \ncertificate from the buyer.\n•\nThe seller has no reason to believe any in-\nformation on the certificate is false.\nThe buyer of the diesel fuel or kerosene is liable \nfor the tax if the seller meets these conditions. \nThe buyer is jointly and severally liable if the \nseller doesn't meet these conditions.\nException. The tax doesn't apply to a sale \nif all of the following apply.\n•\nThe buyer's principal place of business \nisn't in the United States.\n•\nThe sale occurs as the fuel is delivered into \na transport vessel with a capacity of at \nleast 20,000 barrels of fuel.\n•\nThe seller is a registrant and the exporter \nof record.\n•\nThe fuel was exported.\nRemoval or sale of blended diesel fuel or \nkerosene. The removal or sale of blended die-\nsel fuel or blended kerosene by the blender is \ntaxable. Blended taxable fuel produced using \nbiodiesel is subject to the tax. See Blended tax-\nable fuel under Definitions, earlier.\nThe blender is liable for the tax. The tax is \nfigured on the number of gallons not previously \nsubject to the tax.\n8\nChapter 1\nFuel Taxes\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nPersons who blend biodiesel with undyed \ndiesel fuel to produce and sell or use a biodie-\nsel mixture outside the bulk transfer/terminal \nsystem must pay the diesel fuel tax on the vol-\nume of biodiesel in the mixture. Generally, the \nbiodiesel mixture must be diesel fuel. See Form \n720 to report this tax. You must also be regis-\ntered by the IRS as a blender. See Form 637 for \nmore information.\nHowever, if an untaxed liquid is sold as taxa-\nble fuel and that untaxed liquid is used to pro-\nduce blended taxable fuel, the person that sold \nthe untaxed liquid is jointly and severally liable \nfor the tax imposed on the blender's sale or re-\nmoval of the blended taxable fuel.\nAdditional persons liable. When the person \nliable for the tax willfully fails to pay the tax, joint \nand several liability for the tax applies to:\n•\nAny officer, employee, or agent of the per-\nson who is under a duty to ensure the pay-\nment of the tax and who willfully fails to \nperform that duty; or\n•\nAnyone who willfully causes the person to \nfail to pay the tax.\nCredits or refunds. A credit or refund is allow-\nable for the tax on undyed diesel fuel or undyed \nkerosene used for a nontaxable use. For more \ninformation, see chapter 2.\nDyed Diesel Fuel and Dyed \nKerosene\nDyed diesel fuel and dyed kerosene \nare subject to $0.001 per gallon LUST \ntax as discussed below, unless the fuel \nis for export.\nThe excise tax isn't imposed on the removal, \nentry, or sale of diesel fuel or kerosene (other \nthan the LUST tax) if all the following tests are \nmet.\n•\nThe person otherwise liable for tax (for ex-\nample, the position holder) is a registrant.\n•\nIn the case of a removal from a terminal, \nthe terminal is an approved terminal.\n•\nThe diesel fuel or kerosene satisfies the \ndyeing requirements.\nDyeing requirements. Diesel fuel or kerosene \nsatisfies the dyeing requirements only if it satis-\nfies the following requirements.\n•\nIt contains the dye Solvent Red 164 (and \nno other dye) at a concentration spectrally \nequivalent to at least 3.9 pounds of the \nsolid dye standard Solvent Red 26 per \nthousand barrels of fuel or any dye of a \ntype and in a concentration that has been \napproved by the Commissioner.\n•\nIs indelibly dyed by mechanical injection. \nSee IRS.gov/irb/\n2005-46_IRB#NOT-2005-80 section 6 for \ntransition rules that apply until final regula-\ntions are issued by the IRS.\nNotice required. A legible and conspicuous \nnotice stating either: DYED DIESEL FUEL, \nNONTAXABLE USE ONLY, PENALTY FOR \nTAXABLE USE or DYED KEROSENE, NON-\nTAXABLE USE ONLY, PENALTY FOR TAXA-\nBLE USE must be:\nCAUTION\n!\n1. Provided by the terminal operator to any \nperson that receives dyed diesel fuel or \ndyed kerosene at a terminal rack of that \noperator, and\n2. Posted by a seller on any retail pump or \nother delivery facility where it sells dyed \ndiesel fuel or dyed kerosene for use by its \nbuyer.\nThe notice under item (1) must be provided \nby the time of the removal and must appear on \nall shipping papers, bills of lading, and similar \ndocuments accompanying the removal of the \nfuel.\nAny seller that fails to post the required no-\ntice under item (2) is presumed to know that the \nfuel will be used for a taxable use (a use other \nthan a nontaxable use listed later). That seller is \nsubject to the penalty described next.\nPenalty. A penalty is imposed on a person if \nany of the following situations apply.\n1. Any dyed fuel is sold or held for sale by the \nperson for a use the person knows or has \nreason to know isn't a nontaxable use of \nthe fuel.\n2. Any dyed fuel is held for use or used by \nthe person for a use other than a nontaxa-\nble use and the person knew, or had rea-\nson to know, that the fuel was dyed.\n3. The person willfully alters or attempts to \nalter, chemically or otherwise, the strength \nor composition of any dye in dyed fuel.\n4. The person who has knowledge that a \ndyed fuel which has been altered as de-\nscribed in (3) above, sells or holds for sale \nsuch fuel for any use for which the person \nknows or has reason to know isn't a non-\ntaxable use of the fuel.\nThe penalty is the greater of $1,000 or $10 \nper gallon of the dyed diesel fuel or dyed kero-\nsene involved. After the first violation, the \n$1,000 portion of the penalty increases depend-\ning on the number of violations.\nThis penalty is in addition to any tax im-\nposed on the fuel.\nIf the penalty is imposed, each officer, em-\nployee, or agent of a business entity who will-\nfully participated in any act giving rise to the \npenalty is jointly and severally liable with that \nentity for the penalty.\nThere is no administrative appeal or review \nallowed for the third and subsequent penalty im-\nposed by section 6715 on any person except \nfor:\n•\nFraud or a mistake in the chemical analy-\nsis, or\n•\nMathematical calculation of the penalty.\nIf you're liable for the penalty, you may also \nbe liable for the back-up tax, discussed later. \nHowever, the penalty applies only to dyed die-\nsel fuel and dyed kerosene, while the back-up \ntax may apply to other fuels. The penalty may \napply if the fuel is held for sale or use for a taxa-\nble use while the back-up tax doesn't apply un-\nless the fuel is delivered into a fuel supply tank.\nException to penalty. The penalty under \nitem (3) won’t apply in any of the following situa-\ntions.\n•\nDiesel fuel or kerosene meeting the dyeing \nrequirements is blended with any undyed \nliquid and the resulting product meets the \ndyeing requirements.\n•\nDiesel fuel or kerosene meeting the dyeing \nrequirements is blended with any other liq-\nuid (other than diesel fuel or kerosene) that \ncontains the type and amount of dye re-\nquired to meet the dyeing requirements.\n•\nThe alteration or attempted alteration oc-\ncurs in an exempt area of Alaska. See Re-\nmoval for sale or use in Alaska, later.\n•\nDiesel fuel or kerosene meeting the dyeing \nrequirements is blended with diesel fuel or \nkerosene not meeting the dyeing require-\nments and the blending occurs as part of a \nnontaxable use (other than export), dis-\ncussed later.\nAlaska and Feedstocks\nTax of $0.001 per gallon is imposed on:\n•\nUndyed diesel fuel or undyed kerosene \nsold or used in Alaska for certain nontaxa-\nble uses (see Later sales, later).\n•\nUndyed kerosene used for feedstock pur-\nposes.\nRemoval for sale or use in Alaska. No tax is \nimposed on the removal, entry, or sale of diesel \nfuel or kerosene in Alaska for ultimate sale or \nuse in certain areas of Alaska for certain non-\ntaxable uses. The removal or entry of any diesel \nfuel or kerosene isn't taxed if all the following re-\nquirements are satisfied.\n1. The person otherwise liable for the tax \n(position holder, refiner, or enterer):\na. Is a registrant,\nb. Can show satisfactory evidence of the \nnontaxable nature of the transaction, \nand\nc. Has no reason to believe the evidence \nis false.\n2. In the case of a removal from a terminal, \nthe terminal is an approved terminal.\n3. The owner of the fuel immediately after the \nremoval or entry holds the fuel for its own \nuse in a nontaxable use (discussed later) \nor is a qualified dealer.\nIf all three of the requirements above aren’t \nmet, then tax is imposed at $0.244 per gallon.\nQualified dealer. A qualified dealer is any per-\nson that holds a qualified dealer license from \nthe state of Alaska or has been registered by \nthe IRS as a qualified retailer. Satisfactory evi-\ndence may include copies of qualified dealer li-\ncenses or exemption certificates obtained for \nstate tax purposes.\nLater sales. The excise tax applies to die-\nsel fuel or kerosene sold by a qualified dealer \nafter the removal or entry. The tax is imposed at \nthe time of the sale and the qualified dealer is li-\nable for the tax. However, the sale isn't taxable \nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 1\nFuel Taxes\n9\n(other than the LUST tax at $0.001 per gallon) if \nall the following requirements are met.\n•\nThe fuel is sold in Alaska for certain non-\ntaxable uses.\n•\nThe buyer buys the fuel for its own use in a \nnontaxable use or is a qualified dealer.\n•\nThe seller can show satisfactory evidence \nof the nontaxable nature of the transaction \nand has no reason to believe the evidence \nis false.\nFeedstock purposes. The $0.001 per gallon \nLUST tax is imposed on the removal or entry of \nundyed kerosene if all the following conditions \nare met.\n1. The person otherwise liable for tax (posi-\ntion holder, refiner, or enterer) is a regis-\ntrant.\n2. In the case of a removal from a terminal, \nthe terminal is an approved terminal.\n3. Either:\na. The person otherwise liable for tax \nuses the kerosene for a feedstock \npurpose; or\nb. The kerosene is sold for use by the \nbuyer for a feedstock purpose and, at \nthe time of the sale, the person other-\nwise liable for tax has an unexpired \ncertificate from the buyer and has no \nreason to believe any information on \nthe certificate is false.\nIf all of the requirements above aren’t met, \nthen tax is imposed at $0.244 per gallon.\nKerosene is used for a feedstock purpose \nwhen it's used for nonfuel purposes in the man-\nufacture or production of any substance other \nthan gasoline, diesel fuel, or other fuels. For ex-\nample, kerosene is used for a feedstock pur-\npose when it's used as an ingredient in the pro-\nduction of paint, but isn't used for a feedstock \npurpose when it's used to power machinery at a \nfactory where paint is produced. A feedstock \nuser is a person that uses kerosene for a feed-\nstock purpose. A registered feedstock user is a \nperson that has been registered by the IRS as a \nfeedstock user. See Registration Requirements, \nearlier.\nLater sales. The excise tax ($0.244 per \ngallon) applies to kerosene sold for use by the \nbuyer for a feedstock purpose if the buyer in \nthat sale later sells the kerosene. The tax is im-\nposed at the time of the later sale and that seller \nis liable for the tax.\nCertificate. The certificate from the buyer \ncertifies the buyer is a registered feedstock user \nand the kerosene will be used by the buyer for a \nfeedstock purpose. The certificate may be inclu-\nded as part of any business records normally \nused for a sale. A model certificate is shown in \nthe Appendix as Model Certificate G. Your cer-\ntificate must contain all information necessary \nto complete the model.\nA certificate expires on the earliest of the fol-\nlowing dates.\n•\nThe date 1 year after the effective date (not \nearlier than the date signed) of the certifi-\ncate.\n•\nThe date the seller is provided a new certif-\nicate or notice that the current certificate is \ninvalid.\n•\nThe date the seller is notified the buyer's \nregistration has been revoked or suspen-\nded.\nThe buyer must provide a new certificate if \nany information on a certificate has changed.\nBack-up Tax\nTax is imposed on the delivery of any of the fol-\nlowing into the fuel supply tank of a diesel-pow-\nered highway vehicle.\n•\nAny dyed diesel fuel or dyed kerosene for \nother than a nontaxable use.\n•\nAny undyed diesel fuel or undyed kerosene \non which a credit or refund (for fuel used \nfor a nontaxable purpose) has been al-\nlowed.\n•\nAny liquid other than gasoline, diesel fuel, \nor kerosene.\nGenerally, this back-up tax is imposed at a \nrate of $0.244 per gallon.\nLiability for tax. Generally, the operator of the \nvehicle into which the fuel is delivered is liable \nfor the tax. In addition, the seller of the diesel \nfuel or kerosene is jointly and severally liable for \nthe tax if the seller knows or has reason to know \nthat the fuel will be used for other than a nontax-\nable use.\nExemptions from the back-up tax. The \nback-up tax doesn't apply to a delivery of diesel \nfuel or kerosene for uses 1, 2, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, \nand 15 listed under Definitions of Nontaxable \nUses in chapter 2.\nIn addition, since the back-up tax is imposed \nonly on the delivery into the fuel supply tank of a \ndiesel-powered vehicle or train, the tax doesn't \napply to diesel fuel or kerosene used as heating \noil or in stationary engines.\nDiesel-Water Fuel \nEmulsion\nDiesel-water fuel emulsion means diesel fuel at \nleast 14% of which is water and for which the \nemulsion additive is registered by a U.S. manu-\nfacturer with the EPA under section 211 of the \nClean Air Act as in effect on March 31, 2003.\nA reduced tax rate of $0.198 per gallon is \nimposed on a diesel-water fuel emulsion. To be \neligible for the reduced rate, the person who \nsells, removes, or uses the diesel-water fuel \nemulsion must be registered by the IRS. If the \ndiesel-water fuel emulsion doesn't meet the re-\nquirements above, or if the person who sells, re-\nmoves, or uses the fuel isn't registered, the die-\nsel-water fuel emulsion is taxed at $0.244 per \ngallon.\nCredits or refunds. The allowance for a credit \nor refund on a diesel-water fuel emulsion is dis-\ncussed in chapter 2.\nKerosene for Use in \nAviation\nCommercial aviation. Commercial aviation \nmeans any use of an aircraft in the business of \ntransporting persons or property for compensa-\ntion or hire by air, unless one of the following ex-\nemptions apply.\n•\nAny use exclusively for the purpose of sky-\ndiving.\n•\nCertain air transportation by seaplane. See \nSeaplanes under Transportation of Per-\nsons by Air.\n•\nAny use of an aircraft owned or leased by a \nmember of an affiliated group and unavail-\nable for hire by nonmembers.

See Surtax on fuel used in a frac-\ntional ownership program aircraft, later.\nForeign trade. Foreign trade means fuel used \nin civil aircraft employed in foreign trade or trade \nbetween the United States and any of its territo-\nries. The term “trade” includes the transporta-\ntion of persons or property for hire and the mak-\ning of the necessary preparations for such \ntransportation. In the case of aircraft registered \nin a foreign country, the country must allow re-\nciprocal benefits for aircraft registered in the \nUnited States.\nNoncommercial \naviation. Noncommercial \naviation means any use of an aircraft not descri-\nbed as commercial aviation.\nNontaxable use. Nontaxable use means a use \nthat is exempt from federal excise tax, excluding \nLUST tax. Aviation fuel used in foreign trade is \nexempt from federal excise tax, including LUST \ntax. Nontaxable uses include the following.\n•\nFor use on a farm for farming purposes.\n•\nFor use in certain helicopter and fixed-wing \nair ambulance.\n•\nFor use other than as a fuel in the propul-\nsion engine of an aircraft.\n•\nFor the exclusive use of a qualified blood \ncollector organization.\n•\nFor the exclusive use of a nonprofit educa-\ntional organization.\n•\nFor the exclusive use of a state.\n•\nFor use in an aircraft owned by an aircraft \nmuseum.\n•\nFor use in military aircraft.\n•\nFor use in foreign trade.\nRegistered commercial aviation operator. \nRegistered commercial aviation operator means \na commercial aviation operator that is regis-\ntered with the IRS with Form 637 activity letter \n“Y” that buys kerosene for its use in commercial \naviation (other than foreign trade).\nSecured airport terminal (SAT).  SAT means \na terminal located within a secured area of an \nairport. Notice 2016-15, found at IRS.gov/irb/\n2016-13_IRB#NOT-2016-15, contains the crite-\nria for a SAT designation.

The SAT designation \ndoesn’t relate to, and isn’t based on, the general \nsecurity of the airports or associated fuel termi-\nnals, regardless of whether the facility is inclu-\nded (or not included) in the list.\nQualified refueler trucks, tankers, and tank \nwagons treated as terminals (qualifying re-\nfueler).  For purposes of the tax imposed on \nkerosene for use in aviation, which is removed \ndirectly into the fuel tank of an aircraft for use in \naviation, qualifying refuelers are treated as part \nof a terminal if all the following conditions are \nmet:\n1. Such terminal is located within an area of \nan airport;\n2. Any kerosene for use in aviation that is loa-\nded in a refueler truck, tanker, or tank \nwagon at a terminal is for delivery into air-\ncraft at the airport in which the terminal is \nlocated;\n3. Except in exigent circumstances, such as \nthose identified in Notice 2005-80, no ve-\nhicle registered for highway use is loaded \nwith kerosene for use in aviation at the ter-\nminal; and\n4. The qualifying refueler meets the following \nrequirements:\n•\nHas storage tanks, hose, and cou-\npling equipment designed and used \nfor fueling aircraft;\n•\nIsn’t registered for highway use; and\n•\nIs operated by the terminal operator \nor a person that makes a daily ac-\ncounting to the terminal operator of \neach delivery of fuel from the qualify-\ning refueler.\nTaxable Events\nGenerally, kerosene is taxed at $0.244 per gal-\nlon unless a reduced rate applies (see Diesel \nFuel and Kerosene, earlier). A reduced rate ap-\nplies to kerosene used in aviation if certain con-\nditions are met.\nThe tax rate for kerosene removed directly \nfrom a terminal, such as through a hydrant sys-\ntem or by a qualifying refueler, into the fuel tank \nof an aircraft for use in aviation is $0.219 per \ngallon. This rate applies if the requirements for a \nfurther reduced rate aren’t met (see Kerosene \nfor Use in Aviation, earlier; Kerosene for use in \naviation, nontaxable uses, later; and Kerosene \nfor use in foreign trade, later). The position \nholder is liable for the tax. The airport terminal \ndoesn't need to be a secured airport terminal for \nthis rate to apply. The qualifying refueler must \nmeet the requirements discussed under Quali-\nfied refueler trucks, tankers, and tank wagons \ntreated as terminals (qualifying refueler), earlier.\nFuel used in a fractional ownership program \naircraft is subject to a surtax of $0.141 per gal-\nlon. For more information, see Surtax on Any \nLiquid Used in a Fractional Ownership Program \nAircraft as Fuel, later.\nKerosene for use in commercial aviation. \nThe tax rate for kerosene removed directly from \na terminal, such as through a hydrant system or \nby a qualifying refueler, into the fuel tank of an \naircraft for use in commercial aviation is $0.044 \nper gallon. For kerosene removed into an air-\ncraft from a qualifying refueler, this rate only ap-\nplies if the qualifying refueler is loaded at a SAT. \nSee Secured airport terminal (SAT), earlier. The \nqualifying refuelers must meet the requirements \ndiscussed under Qualified refueler trucks, tank-\ners, and tank wagons treated as terminals \n(qualifying refueler), earlier. The registered \ncommercial aviation operator is liable for the \ntax. See Registered commercial aviation opera-\ntor, earlier. For the lower rate to apply, the oper-\nator must be a registered commercial aviation \noperator and must provide the position holder \nwith a certificate similar to Model Certificate K in \nthe Appendix. See Certificate for Commercial \nAviation or Nontaxable Uses, later.\nIn addition, for the registered commercial \naviation operator to be liable at the $0.044 tax \nrate instead of the position holder, the position \nholder must meet the following requirements:\n•\nIs a taxable fuel registrant;\n•\nHas an unexpired certificate (a model cer-\ntificate is shown in the Appendix as Model \nCertificate K) from the operator of the air-\ncraft; and\n•\nHas no reason to believe any of the infor-\nmation in the certificate is false.\nNote. The $0.044 rate is only applicable to \nthe registered commercial aviation operator. If \nthe conditions above aren’t met, the position \nholder is liable for tax at the $0.244 or $0.219 \nrate and a claim may be filed by either the ulti-\nmate purchaser or the registered ultimate ven-\ndor.\nKerosene for use in aviation, nontaxable \nuses.  The tax rate for kerosene removed di-\nrectly from a terminal, such as through a hy-\ndrant system or by a qualifying refueler, into the \nfuel tank of an aircraft for nontaxable use (other \nthan foreign trade) is $0.001 per gallon. The po-\nsition holder is liable for the tax. For this rate to \napply, the operator must provide the position \nholder with a certificate similar to Model Certifi-\ncate K in the Appendix. See Certificate for \nCommercial Aviation or Nontaxable Uses, later. \nThe airport terminal doesn't need to be a SAT \nfor this rate to apply to hydrant removals. How-\never, in the case of a qualifying refueler, the air-\nport terminal must be a SAT and the qualifying \nrefueler must meet the requirements discussed \nunder Qualified refueler trucks, tankers, and \ntank wagons treated as terminals (qualifying re-\nfueler), earlier.\nKerosene for use in foreign trade.  There is \nno tax for kerosene removed directly from a ter-\nminal, such as through a hydrant system or by a \nqualifying refueler, into the fuel tank of an air-\ncraft for use in foreign trade. The airport termi-\nnal doesn't need to be a SAT for this rate to ap-\nply to hydrant removals. However, in the case of \na qualifying refueler, the airport terminal must \nbe a SAT and the qualifying refueler must meet \nthe requirements discussed under Qualified re-\nfueler trucks, tankers, and tank wagons treated \nas terminals (qualifying refueler), earlier. For \nthis rate to apply, the operator must provide the \nposition holder with a certificate similar to \nModel Certificate K in the Appendix. See Certifi-\ncate for Commercial Aviation or Nontaxable \nUses, later.\nLiability For Tax\nIf the kerosene is removed directly into the fuel \ntank of an aircraft for use in commercial avia-\ntion, then the registered commercial aviation \noperator of the aircraft in commercial aviation is \nliable for the tax on the removal at the rate of \n$0.044 per gallon. If the kerosene is removed \ndirectly into the fuel tank of an aircraft for a use \nthat is exempt from tax under section 4041(c) \n(except foreign trade), then the position holder \nis liable for the $0.001 LUST tax for kerosene \nfor use in aviation. For example, for kerosene \nremoved directly into the aircraft for use in mili-\ntary aircraft, the position holder is liable for the \ntax.\nFor the registered commercial aviation oper-\nator to be liable for the $0.044 tax rate, the posi-\ntion holder must meet the following require-\nments:\n•\nIs a taxable fuel registrant;\n•\nHas an unexpired certificate (a model cer-\ntificate is shown in the Appendix as Model \nCertificate K) from the operator of the air-\ncraft; and\n•\nHas no reason to believe any of the infor-\nmation in the certificate is false.\nSurtax on Any Liquid \nUsed in a Fractional \nOwnership Program \nAircraft as Fuel\nFuel used in a fractional ownership program air-\ncraft is subject to a surtax of $0.141 per gallon. \nThe fractional ownership program manager is li-\nable for the tax. The surtax applies in addition to \nany other taxes imposed on the removal, entry, \nuse, or sale of the fuel. If the surtax is imposed, \nthe following air transportation taxes don't apply.\n•\nTransportation of persons by air.\n•\nTransportation of property by air.\n•\nUse of international air travel facilities.\nThese taxes are described under Air Trans-\nportation Taxes, later.\nA fractional ownership program aircraft flight \nis considered noncommercial aviation; for the \nrules for kerosene used in noncommercial avia-\ntion, see Kerosene for Use in Aviation, earlier.\nA fractional ownership program is one under \nwhich:\n•\nA single fractional ownership program \nmanager provides fractional ownership \nprogram management services on behalf \nof the fractional owners;\n•\nThere are one or more fractional owners \nper fractional program aircraft, with at least \none fractional program aircraft having more \nthan one owner;\n•\nFor at least two fractional program aircraft, \nnone of the ownership interests in the air-\ncraft are less than the minimum fractional \nownership interest or held by the program \nmanager;\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 1\nFuel Taxes\n11\n•\nThere exists a dry-lease aircraft exchange \narrangement among all of the fractional \nowners; and\n•\nThere are multi-year program agreements \ncovering the fractional ownership, frac-\ntional ownership program management \nservices, and dry-lease aircraft exchange \naspects of the program.\nFractional program aircraft.

The rate on kerosene for \nuse in aviation is $0.001 (LUST tax) if it's re-\nmoved from any refinery or terminal directly into \nthe fuel tank of an aircraft for a nontaxable use. \nA nontaxable use includes kerosene for the ex-\nclusive use of a state or local government. \nThere is no tax on kerosene removed directly \ninto the fuel tank of an aircraft for use in foreign \ntrade.\nFlash title transaction. In a \"flash title trans-\naction,\" the position holder sells the kerosene to \na wholesale distributor (reseller) that in turn \nsells the kerosene to the aircraft operator as the \nkerosene is being removed from a terminal into \nthe fuel tank of an aircraft. A position holder isn't \nliable for tax if, among other conditions, it ob-\ntains a certificate from the operator of the air-\ncraft into which the kerosene is delivered. In this \ncase, the position holder will be treated as hav-\ning a certificate from the operator of the aircraft \nif:\n•\nThe aircraft operator puts the reseller's \nname, address, and EIN on the certificate \nin place of the position holder's informa-\ntion; and\n•\nThe reseller provides the position holder \nwith a statement of the kerosene reseller.\nReseller statement. This is a statement \nthat is signed under penalties of perjury by a \nperson with authority to bind the reseller; is pro-\nvided at the bottom or on the back of the certifi-\ncate (or in an attached document); and con-\ntains:\n•\nThe reseller's name, address, and EIN;\n•\nThe position holder's name, address, and \nEIN; and\n•\nA statement that the reseller has no reason \nto believe that any information in the ac-\ncompanying aircraft operator's certificate is \nfalse.\nCredits or payments. If the aircraft operator \ndoesn’t provide a certificate to the position \nholder, then the ultimate purchaser (the opera-\ntor) may make a claim for the kerosene it uses \nin commercial aviation (other than foreign trade) \nand for nontaxable use (other than for exclusive \nuse by a state or local government). A regis-\ntered ultimate vendor may make a claim for cer-\ntain sales if the ultimate purchaser waives its \nright to make a claim. For more information, see \nKerosene for Use in Aviation, later.\nOther Fuels (Including \nAlternative Fuels)\nOther fuels means any liquid except gas oil, fuel \noil, or any product taxable under section 4081. \nOther fuels include alternative fuels. Alternative \nfuels are:\n•\nLiquefied petroleum gas (LPG),\n•\n“P Series” fuels,\n•\nCompressed natural gas (CNG),\n•\nLiquefied hydrogen,\n•\nAny liquid fuel derived from coal (including \npeat) through the Fischer-Tropsch process,\n•\nLiquid fuel derived from biomass,\n•\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG), and\n•\nLiquefied gas derived from biomass.\nLiquefied petroleum gas includes propane, pen-\ntane, or mixtures of those products.\nQualified methanol and ethanol fuels. \nQualified ethanol and methanol means any liq-\nuid at least 85% of which consists of alcohol \nproduced from coal, including peat. The tax \nrates are listed in the Instructions for Form 720.\nPartially exempt methanol and ethanol \nfuels.  A reduced tax rate applies to these \nfuels. Partially exempt ethanol and methanol \nmeans any liquid at least 85% of which consists \nof alcohol produced from natural gas. The tax \nrates are listed in the Instructions for Form 720.\nMotor vehicles. Motor vehicles include all \ntypes of vehicles, whether or not registered (or \nrequired to be registered) for highway use, that \nhave both the following characteristics.\n•\nThey're propelled by a motor.\n•\nThey’re designed for carrying or towing \nloads from one place to another, regard-\nless of the type of material or load carried \nor towed.\nMotor vehicles don’t include any vehicle that \nmoves exclusively on rails, or any of the follow-\ning items: farm tractors, trench diggers, power \nshovels, bulldozers, road graders, road rollers, \nand similar equipment that doesn't carry or tow \na load.\nTaxable Events\nTax is imposed on the delivery of other fuels into \nthe fuel supply tank of the propulsion engine of \na motor vehicle or motorboat. However, there is \nno tax on the delivery if tax was imposed under \nthe bulk sales rule, discussed next, or the deliv-\nery is for a nontaxable use.

The tax is based on the gasoline gallon \nequivalent of CNG. See Form 720 for the tax \nrate.\nHowever, there is no tax on the delivery if tax \nwas imposed under the bulk sales rule, or the \ndelivery is for a nontaxable use, listed in chap-\nter 2. If the delivery is in connection with a sale, \nthe seller is liable for the tax.

The \nseller of the CNG is liable for the tax.\nMotor vehicle. For this purpose, motor vehicle \nhas the same meaning as given under Other \nFuels (Including Alternative Fuels), earlier.\nNontaxable uses. The nontaxable uses of \nCNG are discussed under Other Fuels (Includ-\ning Alternative Fuels) in chapter 2.\nFuels Used on Inland \nWaterways\nThe tax on inland waterways fuel use \napplies at the rate listed on Form 720. \nThis is in addition to all other taxes im-\nposed on the sale or use of the fuel. \nTax applies to liquid fuel used in the propul-\nsion system of commercial transportation ves-\nsels while traveling on certain inland and intra-\ncoastal waterways in the United States. The tax \ngenerally applies to such use of a liquid fuel in \nall types of vessels, including ships, barges, \nand tugboats. The LUST tax must be paid on \nany liquid fuel used on inland waterways that \nisn't subject to LUST tax under section 4041(d) \nor 4081(a)(2)(B). For example, Bunker C resid-\nual fuel oil is subject to the LUST tax.\nInland and intracoastal waterways. Inland \nand intracoastal waterways on which fuel con-\nsumption is subject to tax are specified in sec-\ntion 206 of the Inland Waterways Revenue Act \nof 1978, as amended. See Regulations section \n48.4042-1(g) for a list of these waterways.\nCommercial waterway transportation. Com-\nmercial waterway transportation is the use of a \nvessel on inland or intracoastal waterways for \neither of the following purposes.\n•\nThe use is in the business of transporting \nproperty for compensation or hire.\n•\nThe use is in transporting property in the \nbusiness of the owner, lessee, or operator \nof the vessel (other than fish or aquatic ani-\nmal life caught on the voyage), whether or \nnot a fee is charged.\nThe operation of all vessels meeting either \nof these requirements is commercial waterway \ntransportation regardless of whether the vessel \nis actually transporting property on a particular \nvoyage. However, see Exemptions in chapter 7, \nlater. The tax is imposed on fuel consumed in \nvessels while engaged in any of the following \nactivities.\n•\nMoving without cargo.\n•\nAwaiting passage through locks.\n•\nMoving to or from a repair facility.\n•\nDislodging vessels grounded on a sand \nbar.\n•\nFleeting barges into a single tow.\n•\nManeuvering around loading and unload-\ning docks.\nLiquid fuel. Liquid fuel includes diesel fuel, \nBunker C residual fuel oil, gasoline, and other \nfuels. The tax is imposed on liquid fuel actually \nconsumed by a vessel's propulsion engine and \nnot on the unconsumed fuel in a vessel's tank.\nDual use of liquid fuels. The tax applies to all \ntaxable liquid used as a fuel in the propulsion \nsystem of the vessel, regardless of whether the \nengine (or other propulsion system) is used for \nanother purpose. The tax applies to all liquid \nfuel consumed by the propulsion engine even if \nit operates special equipment by means of a \npower take-off or power transfer. For example, \nthe fuel used in the engine both to operate an \nCAUTION\n!\nalternator, generator, or pumps and to propel \nthe vessel is taxable.\nThe tax doesn't apply to fuel consumed in \nengines not used to propel the vessel.\nIf you draw liquid fuel from the same tank to \noperate both a propulsion engine and a nonpro-\npulsion engine, determine the fuel used in the \nnonpropulsion engine and exclude that fuel \nfrom the tax. The IRS will accept a reasonable \nestimate of the fuel based on your operating ex-\nperience, but you must keep records to support \nyour allocation.\nVoyages crossing boundaries of the speci-\nfied waterways. The tax applies to fuel con-\nsumed by a vessel crossing the boundaries of \nthe specified waterways only to the extent of \nfuel consumed for propulsion while on those \nwaterways. Generally, the operator may figure \nthe fuel so used during a particular voyage by \nmultiplying total fuel consumed in the propul-\nsion engine by a fraction. The numerator of the \nfraction is the time spent operating on the speci-\nfied waterways and the denominator is the total \ntime spent on the voyage. This calculation can't \nbe used where it's found to be unreasonable.\nTaxable event. Tax is imposed on liquid fuel \nused in the propulsion system of a vessel.\nThe person who operates (or whose em-\nployees operate) the vessel in which the fuel is \nconsumed is liable for the tax. If a vessel owner \n(or lessee) contracts with an independent con-\ntractor to operate the vessel, the independent \ncontractor is the person liable for tax, regard-\nless of who purchases the fuel. The tax is paid \nwith Form 720. No tax deposits are required.\nExemptions. Certain types of commercial wa-\nterway transportation are excluded from the tax.\nFishing vessels. Fuel isn't taxable when \nused by a fishing vessel while traveling to a fish-\ning site, while engaged in fishing, or while re-\nturning from the fishing site with its catch. A \nvessel isn't transporting property in the busi-\nness of the owner, lessee, or operator by merely \ntransporting fish or other aquatic animal life \ncaught on the voyage.\nHowever, the tax does apply to fuel used by \na commercial vessel along the specified water-\nways while traveling to pick up aquatic animal \nlife caught by another vessel and while trans-\nporting the catch of that other vessel.\nDeep-draft \nocean-going \nvessels. Fuel \nisn't taxable when used by a vessel designed \nprimarily for use on the high seas and that has a \ndraft of more than 12 feet on the voyage. For \neach voyage, figure the draft when the vessel \nhas its greatest load of cargo and fuel. A voyage \nis a round trip. If a vessel has a draft of more \nthan 12 feet on at least one way of the voyage, \nthe vessel satisfies the 12-foot draft require-\nment for the entire voyage.\nPassenger \nvessels. Fuel \nisn't \ntaxable \nwhen used by vessels primarily for the transpor-\ntation of persons. The tax doesn't apply to fuel \nused in commercial passenger vessels while \nbeing operated as passenger vessels, even if \nsuch vessels also transport property. Nor does \nit apply to ferryboats carrying passengers and \ntheir cars.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 1\nFuel Taxes\n13\nOcean-going barges. Fuel isn't taxable \nwhen used in tugs to move LASH (Lighter \nAboard Ship) and SEABEE ocean-going barges \nreleased by their ocean-going carriers solely to \npick up or deliver international cargoes.\nHowever, it's taxable when any of the follow-\ning conditions apply.\n•\nOne or more of the barges in the tow isn't a \nLASH barge, SEABEE barge, or other \nocean-going barge carried aboard an \nocean-going vessel.\n•\nOne or more of the barges isn't on an inter-\nnational voyage.\n•\nPart of the cargo carried isn't being trans-\nported internationally.\nState or local governments. No tax is im-\nposed on the fuel used in a vessel operated by \na state or local government in transporting prop-\nerty on official business. The ultimate use of the \ncargo must be for a function ordinarily carried \nout by governmental units. An Indian tribal gov-\nernment is treated as a state only if the fuel is \nused in the exercise of an essential tribal gov-\nernment function.\nAll operators of vessels used in com-\nmercial waterway transportation who \nacquire liquid fuel must keep adequate \nrecords of all fuel used for taxable purposes. \nOperators who are seeking an exclusion from \nthe tax must keep records that will support any \nexclusion claimed.\nYour records should include all of the follow-\ning information.\n•\nThe acquisition date and quantity of fuel \ndelivered into storage tanks or the tanks on \nyour vessel.\n•\nThe identification number or name of each \nvessel using the fuel.\n•\nThe departure time, departure point, route \ntraveled, destination, and arrival time for \neach vessel.\nIf you claim an exemption from the tax, in-\nclude in your records the following additional in-\nformation as it pertains to you.\n•\nThe draft of the vessel on each voyage.\n•\nThe type of vessel in which you used the \nfuel.\n•\nThe ultimate use of the cargo (for vessels \noperated by state or local governments).\nSecond Generation \nBiofuel Not Used as Fuel\nIf you claimed the section 40 second generation \nbiofuel producer credit, you're liable for an ex-\ncise tax on each gallon of second generation bi-\nofuel if you don't use the fuel for the purposes \ndescribed under Qualified Second Generation \nBiofuel Production next.\nQualified second generation biofuel pro-\nduction.

The ultimate purchaser may \nfile a claim for nontaxable use of kerosene used \nin aviation if the ultimate purchaser didn't pro-\nvide a waiver to the ultimate vendor with respect \nto the claim.\nThe following are the nontaxable uses of \nkerosene used in aviation for which an ultimate \npurchaser may make a claim.\n•\nOn a farm for farming purposes.\n•\nIn foreign trade.\n•\nCertain helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft \nuses.\n•\nFor use other than as a fuel in the propul-\nsion engine of an aircraft.\n•\nExclusive use by a qualified blood collector \norganization.\n•\nExclusive use by a nonprofit educational \norganization.\n•\nIn an aircraft owned by an aircraft museum.\n•\nIn military aircraft.\nSee Sales by Registered Ultimate Vendors \n(Other Than State or Local Government Pur-\nchases), later, for information about registered \nultimate vendor claims.\nKerosene for use in aviation by a state or \nlocal government.  A state or local govern-\nment may generally not file an ultimate pur-\nchaser claim for nontaxable use of kerosene \nused in aviation. Generally, only a registered \ncredit card issuer or a registered ultimate ven-\ndor may file a claim for kerosene sold for use in \naviation to a state or local government for its ex-\nclusive use (including essential government use \nby an Indian tribal government).\nState or local government credit card pur-\nchases. If taxed kerosene for use in aviation is \npurchased with a credit card issued to a state or \nlocal government, then the person who exten-\nded credit to the state or local government (the \ncredit card issuer) is treated as the person that \npaid the tax and may make the claim. In order \nfor the credit card issuer to make the claim, the \ncredit card issuer must be registered by the IRS \nwith Form 637 activity letter \"CC\" and have the \nrequired certificate from the ultimate purchaser. \nA sample certificate is included as Model Certif-\nicate R in the Appendix. The credit card issuer \nmust have the certificate at the time the claim is \nfiled.\nIf the requirements above aren't met by the \ncredit card issuer, then the credit card issuer \nmust collect the tax from the ultimate purchaser \n(state or local government) and only the ulti-\nmate purchaser may make the claim.\nState or local government purchases not \nmade with a credit card.  If a state or local \ngovernment purchases kerosene for use in avia-\ntion without the use of a credit card, the ultimate \nvendor is the only person that may make a \nclaim. In order for the ultimate vendor to make \nthe claim, the ultimate vendor must be regis-\ntered by the IRS with Form 637 activity letter \n\"UV\" and have the required certificate from the \nultimate purchaser. A sample certificate is inclu-\nded as Model Certificate P in the Appendix. The \nregistered ultimate vendor must have the certifi-\ncate at the time the claim is filed.\nSales by Registered Ultimate \nVendors (Other Than State or \nLocal Government \nPurchases)\nKerosene for use in commercial aviation or \nnoncommercial aviation. The registered ulti-\nmate vendor of kerosene for use in commercial \naviation (other than foreign trade) or noncom-\nmercial aviation (other than nonexempt, non-\ncommercial aviation and exclusive use by a \nstate, political subdivision of a state, or the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia) may make this claim if the ulti-\nmate purchaser waives its right to the credit or \npayment by providing the registered ultimate \nvendor with a waiver. A sample waiver is inclu-\nded as Model Waiver L in the Appendix. The \nregistered ultimate vendor must have the waiver \nat the time the credit or payment is claimed.\nNoncommercial aviation means any use of \nan aircraft not described as commercial avia-\ntion. For the definition of commercial aviation, \nsee Commercial aviation, earlier.\nKerosene for use in nonexempt, noncom-\nmercial aviation. Only the registered ultimate \nvendor may claim a credit or payment for sales \nof kerosene for use in nonexempt, noncommer-\ncial aviation. The ultimate vendor must be \n16\nChapter 2\nFuel Tax Credits and Refunds\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nregistered by the IRS (activity letter “UA”) and \nhave the required certificate from the ultimate \npurchaser. A sample certificate is included as \nModel Certificate Q in the Appendix. The regis-\ntered ultimate vendor must have the certificate \nat the time the credit or payment is claimed.\nKerosene for use partly in commercial avia-\ntion and partly in nonexempt, noncommer-\ncial aviation. If the fuel is used partly for use in \ncommercial aviation and partly for use in non-\nexempt, noncommercial aviation, the operator \nmay identify, either at the time of purchase or af-\nter the kerosene has been used, the amount \nthat will be (or has been) used in commercial \naviation. At the same time, the operator would \neither make the claim or waive the right to make \nthe claim for credit or refund of the kerosene for \nuse in commercial and nonexempt, noncom-\nmercial aviation.\nIf the operator doesn't identify the amount of \nkerosene that will be (or has been) used in com-\nmercial aviation, the operator may provide a \ncertificate to the ultimate vendor similar to \nModel Certificate Q in the Appendix. For kero-\nsene purchased with the certificate, used in \ncommercial aviation, and taxed at $0.244 per \ngallon, use of the certificate will be treated as a \nwaiver of the right to claim a credit or refund for \nthe $0.025 per gallon part of the tax. The ulti-\nmate vendor may make this claim. The operator \nmay make a claim for the $0.175 tax per gallon \nof the kerosene, but can't waive the right to \nmake the claim for the $0.175 tax per gallon.\nKerosene for use in aviation by a state or \nlocal government. Only the registered ulti-\nmate vendor may claim a credit or payment for \nsales of kerosene for use in aviation to a state \nor local government for its exclusive use (includ-\ning essential government use by an Indian tribal \ngovernment). The kerosene for use in aviation \nmust be purchased by the state without the use \nof a credit card in order for the ultimate vendor \nto make the claim. The ultimate vendor must be \nregistered by the IRS (activity letter “UV”) and \nhave the required certificate from the ultimate \npurchaser. A sample certificate is included as \nModel Certificate P in the Appendix. The regis-\ntered ultimate vendor must have the certificate \nat the time the credit or payment is claimed.\nCredit card purchases. If taxed kerosene for \nuse in aviation is purchased with a credit card \nissued to a state, the person who extended \ncredit to the state (the credit card issuer) is trea-\nted as the person that paid the tax and makes \nthe claim if the credit card issuer:\n•\nIs registered by the IRS;\n•\nHas established that the amount of tax \nhasn’t been collected from the person who \npurchased the kerosene, or has obtained \nwritten consent from the ultimate pur-\nchaser to the allowance of the credit or re-\nfund;\n•\nHas repaid or agreed to repay the amount \nof the tax to the ultimate vendor, has ob-\ntained the written consent of the ultimate \nvendor to the allowance of the credit or re-\nfund, or has made arrangements that pro-\nvide the ultimate vendor with reimburse-\nment of the tax.\nIf the requirements above aren’t met by the \ncredit card issuer, the credit card issuer must \ncollect the tax from the ultimate purchaser and \nonly the ultimate purchaser may make the \nclaim.\nOther Fuels (Including \nAlternative Fuels)\nCredit or refund for nontaxable use of taxed \nother fuels may be allowable to an ultimate pur-\nchaser. While tax is generally imposed on deliv-\nery, other fuels are taxed prior to delivery in the \ncase of certain bulk sales described in chap-\nter 1. The following are the nontaxable uses of \nother fuels for which a credit or refund may be \nallowable to the ultimate purchaser.\n•\nOn a farm for farming purposes.\n•\nOff-highway business use.\n•\nIn a boat engaged in commercial fishing.\n•\nIn certain intercity and local buses.\n•\nIn a school bus.\n•\nIn a qualified local bus.\n•\nExclusive use by a qualified blood collector \norganization.\n•\nExclusive use by a nonprofit educational \norganization.\n•\nExclusive use by a state, political subdivi-\nsion of a state, or the District of Columbia.\n•\nIn an aircraft or vehicle owned by an air-\ncraft museum.\n•\nIn any boat operated by the United States \nfor its exclusive use or any vessel of war of \nany foreign nation.\nRefunds of Second Tax\nThe tax on dyed diesel fuel for inland \nwaterways fuel use applies at the rate \nlisted on Form 720. This is in addition \nto all other taxes imposed on the sale or use of \nthe fuel. The section 4081(e) refund can't be \nclaimed.\nIf the tax is paid and reported to the govern-\nment on more than one taxable event for a taxa-\nble fuel under section 4081, the person paying \nthe “second tax” may claim a refund (without in-\nterest) of that tax if certain conditions and re-\nporting requirements are met. No credit against \nany tax is allowed for this tax. For information \nabout taxable events, see the discussions un-\nder Gasoline, Diesel Fuel and Kerosene, and \nKerosene for Use in Aviation in chapter 1.\nConditions to allowance of refund. A claim \nfor refund of the tax is allowed only if all the fol-\nlowing conditions are met.\n1. A tax on the fuel was paid to the govern-\nment and not credited or refunded (the \n“first tax”).\n2. After the first tax was imposed, another tax \nwas imposed on the same fuel and was \npaid to the government (the “second tax”).\n3. The person that paid the second tax filed a \ntimely claim for refund containing the infor-\nmation required (see Refund claim, later).\n4. The person that paid the first tax has met \nthe reporting requirements.\nCAUTION\n!\nReporting requirements. Generally, the per-\nson that paid the first tax must file a “First Tax-\npayer's Report” with its Form 720 for the quarter \nto which the report relates. A model first taxpay-\ner's report is shown in the Appendix as Model \nCertificate B. The report must contain all infor-\nmation needed to complete the model certifi-\ncate.\nBy the due date for filing the Form 720, you \nmust also send a separate copy of the report to \nthe following address.\nDepartment of the Treasury\nInternal Revenue Service\nCincinnati, OH 45999-0555\nWrite “EXCISE – FIRST TAXPAYER'S REPORT” \nacross the top of that copy.\nOptional reporting. A first taxpayer's re-\nport isn't required for the tax imposed on:\n•\nRemoval at a terminal rack,\n•\nNonbulk entries into the United States, and\n•\nRemovals or sales by blenders.\nHowever, if the person liable for the tax expects \nthat another tax will be imposed on that fuel, \nthat person should (but isn't required to) file a \nfirst taxpayer's report.\nProviding information. The first taxpayer \nmust give a copy of the report to the buyer of \nthe fuel within the bulk transfer/terminal system \nor to the owner of the fuel immediately before \nthe first tax was imposed, if the first taxpayer \nisn't the owner at that time. If an optional report \nis filed, a copy should (but isn't required to) be \ngiven to the buyer or owner.\nA person that receives a copy of the first tax-\npayer's report and later sells the fuel within the \nbulk transfer/terminal system must give the \ncopy and a “Statement of Subsequent Seller” to \nthe buyer. If the later sale is outside the bulk \ntransfer/terminal system and that person ex-\npects that another tax will be imposed, that per-\nson should (but isn't required to) give the copy \nand the statement to the buyer. A model state-\nment of subsequent seller is shown in the Ap-\npendix as Model Certificate A. The statement \nmust contain all information necessary to com-\nplete the model.\nIf the first taxpayer's report relates to fuel \nsold to more than one buyer, copies of that re-\nport must be made when the fuel is divided. \nEach buyer must be given a copy of the report.\nRefund claim. You must have filed Form 720 \nand paid the second tax before you file for a re-\nfund of that tax. You must make your claim for \nrefund on Form 8849. Complete Schedule 5 \n(Form 8849) and attach it to your Form 8849. \nDon't include this claim with a claim under an-\nother tax provision. You must not have included \nthe second tax in the price of the fuel and must \nnot have collected it from the purchaser. You \nmust submit the following information with your \nclaim.\n•\nA copy of the first taxpayer's report.\n•\nA copy of the statement of the subsequent \nseller if the fuel was bought from someone \nother than the first taxpayer.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 2\nFuel Tax Credits and Refunds\n17\nDefinitions of \nNontaxable Uses\nThis section provides definitions of the terms \nused in Table 2-1 for nontaxable uses.

To operate, manage, conserve, improve, \nor maintain your farm and its tools and \nequipment.\n4. To handle, dry, pack, grade, or store any \nraw agricultural or horticultural commodity. \nFor this use to qualify, you must have pro-\nduced more than half the commodity so \ntreated during the tax year. Commodity \nmeans a single raw product. For example, \napples and peaches are two separate \ncommodities.\n5. To plant, cultivate, care for, or cut trees or \nto prepare (other than sawing logs into \nlumber, chipping, or other milling) trees for \nmarket, but only if the planting, etc., is inci-\ndental to your farming operations. Your \ntree operations will be incidental only if \nthey're minor in nature when compared to \nthe total farming operations.\nIf any other person, such as a neighbor or \ncustom operator, performs a service for you on \nyour farm for any of the purposes listed in (1) or \n(2), you're considered to be the ultimate pur-\nchaser that used the fuel on a farm for farming \npurposes.\nIf doubt exists whether the owner, the ten-\nant, or the operator of the farm bought the fuel, \ndetermine who bore the cost of the fuel. For ex-\nample, if the owner of a farm and the tenant \nequally share the cost of gasoline that is used \non a farm for farming purposes, each can claim \na credit for the tax on one-half of the fuel used.\nCustom application of fertilizer and pes-\nticide. Fuel used on a farm for farming purpo-\nses includes fuel used in the application of fertil-\nizer, pesticides, or other substances, including \naerial applications. Generally, the applicator is \ntreated as having used the fuel on a farm for \nfarming purposes. For aviation gasoline, the \naerial applicator makes the claim as the ulti-\nmate purchaser. For kerosene used in aviation, \nthe ultimate purchaser may make the claim or \nwaive their right to make the claim to the regis-\ntered ultimate vendor.\nFuel used between airfield and farm. \nFuel used by an aerial applicator for the direct \nflight between the airfield and one or more \nfarms is treated as a farming purpose.\nFuel not used for farming. Fuel isn't used \non a farm for farming purposes if it's used in any \nof the following ways.\n•\nOff the farm, such as on the highway or in \nnoncommercial aviation, other than fuel \nused between the airfield and farm descri-\nbed above, even if the fuel is used in trans-\nporting livestock, feed, crops, or equip-\nment.\n•\nFor personal use, such as mowing the \nlawn.\n•\nIn processing, packaging, freezing, or can-\nning operations.\n•\nIn processing crude gum into gum spirits of \nturpentine or gum resin or in processing \nmaple sap into maple syrup or maple \nsugar.\nOff-highway business use (No. 2). Off-high-\nway business use means fuel used in a trade or \nbusiness or in an income-producing activity \nother than as a fuel in a highway vehicle regis-\ntered or required to be registered for use on \npublic highways. The terms “highway vehicle,” \n“public highway,” and “registered” are defined \nbelow. Don't consider any use in a boat as an \noff-highway business use.\nOff-highway business use includes fuels \nused in any of the following ways.\n•\nIn stationary machines such as generators, \ncompressors, power saws, and similar \nequipment.\n•\nFor cleaning purposes.\n•\nIn forklift trucks, bulldozers, and earthmov-\ners.\nGenerally, this use doesn't include nonbusi-\nness use of fuel, such as use by minibikes, \nsnowmobiles, power lawn mowers, chain saws, \nand other yard equipment.\nExample. Shannon owns a landscaping \nbusiness. Shannon uses power lawn mowers \nand chain saws in the landscaping business. \nThe gasoline used in the power lawn mowers \nand chain saws qualifies as fuel used in an \noff-highway business use. The gasoline used in \nthe personal lawn mower at home doesn't qual-\nify.\nHighway vehicle. A highway vehicle is any \nself-propelled vehicle designed to carry a load \nover public highways, whether or not it's also \ndesigned to perform other functions. Examples \nof vehicles designed to carry a load over public \nhighways are passenger automobiles, motorcy-\ncles, buses, and highway-type trucks and truck \ntractors. A vehicle is a highway vehicle even \nthough the vehicle's design allows it to perform \na highway transportation function for only one of \nthe following.\n•\nA particular type of load, such as passen-\ngers, furnishings, and personal effects (as \nin a house, office, or utility trailer).\n•\nA special kind of cargo, goods, supplies, or \nmaterials.\n•\nSome off-highway task unrelated to high-\nway transportation, except as discussed \nnext.\nVehicles not considered highway vehi-\ncles. Generally, the following kinds of vehicles \nTable 2-1. Type of Use Table\n No.\nType of Use \n1\nOn a farm for farming purposes\n2\nOff-highway business use (for business use other than in a highway vehicle \nregistered or required to be registered for highway use) (other than use in mobile \nmachinery)\n3\nExport\n4\nIn a boat engaged in commercial fishing\n5\nIn certain intercity and local buses\n6\nIn a qualified local bus\n7\nIn a bus transporting students and employees of schools (school buses)\n8\nFor diesel fuel and kerosene (other than kerosene used in aviation) used other \nthan as a fuel in the propulsion engine of a train or diesel-powered highway \nvehicle (but not off-highway business use)\n9\nIn foreign trade\n10\nCertain helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft uses\n11\nExclusive use by a qualified blood collector organization\n12\nIn a highway vehicle owned by the United States that isn't used on a highway\n13\nExclusive use by a nonprofit educational organization\n14\nExclusive use by a state, political subdivision of a state, or the District of \nColumbia\n15\nIn an aircraft or vehicle owned by an aircraft museum\n16\nIn military aircraft\n18\nChapter 2\nFuel Tax Credits and Refunds\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\naren’t considered highway vehicles for purpo-\nses of the credit or refund of fuel taxes.\n1. Specially designed mobile machinery \nfor nontransportation functions. A \nself-propelled vehicle isn't a highway vehi-\ncle if all the following apply.\na. The chassis has permanently moun-\nted to it machinery or equipment used \nto perform certain operations (con-\nstruction, manufacturing, drilling, min-\ning, timbering, processing, farming, or \nsimilar operations) if the operation of \nthe machinery or equipment is unrela-\nted to transportation on or off the pub-\nlic highways.\nb. The chassis has been specially de-\nsigned to serve only as a mobile car-\nriage and mount (and power source, if \napplicable) for the machinery or \nequipment, whether or not the machi-\nnery or equipment is in operation.\nc. The chassis couldn’t, because of its \nspecial design and without substantial \nstructural modification, be used as \npart of a vehicle designed to carry any \nother load.\nd. The vehicle must have traveled less \nthan 7,500 miles on public highways \nduring the taxable year.\n2. Vehicles specially designed for \noff-highway transportation. A vehicle \nisn't treated as a highway vehicle if the ve-\nhicle is specially designed for the primary \nfunction of transporting a particular type of \nload other than over the public highway \nand because of this special design, the ve-\nhicle's capability to transport a load over a \npublic highway is substantially limited or \nimpaired.\nTo make this determination, you can \ntake into account the vehicle's size, \nwhether the vehicle is subject to licensing, \nsafety, or other requirements, and whether \nthe vehicle can transport a load at a sus-\ntained speed of at least 25 miles per hour. \nIt doesn't matter that the vehicle can carry \nheavier loads off highway than it's allowed \nto carry over the highway.\n3. Nontransportation trailers and semi-\ntrailers. A trailer or semitrailer isn't treated \nas a highway vehicle if it's specially de-\nsigned to function only as an enclosed sta-\ntionary shelter for carrying on a nontrans-\nportation function at an off-highway site. \nFor example, a trailer that is capable only \nof functioning as an office for an off-high-\nway construction operation isn't a highway \nvehicle.\nPublic highway. A public highway includes \nany road in the United States that isn't a private \nroadway. This includes federal, state, county, \nand city roads and streets.\nRegistered. A vehicle is considered registered \nwhen it's registered or required to be registered \nfor highway use under the law of any state, the \nDistrict of Columbia, or any foreign country in \nwhich it's operated or situated. Any highway ve-\nhicle operated under a dealer's tag, license, or \npermit is considered registered. A highway vehi-\ncle isn't considered registered solely because a \nspecial permit allows the vehicle to be operated \nat particular times and under specified condi-\ntions.\nDual use of propulsion motor. Off-highway \nbusiness use doesn't include any fuel used in \nthe propulsion motor of a registered highway ve-\nhicle even though that motor also operates spe-\ncial equipment by means of a power take-off or \npower transfer. It doesn't matter if the special \nequipment is mounted on the vehicle.\nExample. The motor of a registered con-\ncrete-mixer truck operates both the engine and \nthe mixing unit by means of a power take-off. \nThe fuel used in the motor to run the mixer isn't \noff-highway business use.\nUse in separate motor. Off-highway business \nuse includes fuel used in a separate motor to \noperate special equipment, such as a refrigera-\ntion unit, pump, generator, or mixing unit. If you \ndraw fuel from the same tank that supplies fuel \nto the propulsion motor, you must figure the \nquantity used in the separate motor operating \nthe special equipment. You may make a reason-\nable estimate based on your operating experi-\nence and supported by your records.\nYou can use devices that measure the miles \nthe vehicle has traveled (such as hubometers) \nto figure the gallons of fuel used to propel the \nvehicle. Add to this amount the fuel consumed \nwhile idling or warming up the motor before pro-\npelling the vehicle. The difference between your \ntotal fuel used and the fuel used to propel the \nvehicle is the fuel used in the separate motor.\nExample. Hazel owns a refrigerated truck. \nIt has a separate motor for the refrigeration unit. \nThe same tank supplies both motors. Using the \ntruck's hubometer, Hazel figures that 90% of the \nfuel was used to propel the truck. Therefore, \n10% of the fuel is used in an off-highway busi-\nness use.\nFuel lost or destroyed. You can't treat fuel \nlost or destroyed through spillage, fire, or other \ncasualty as fuel used in an off-highway busi-\nness use.\nExport (No. 3). Export means fuel transported \nfrom the United States with the intention that the \nfuel remain in a foreign country or territory of the \nUnited States. Fuel isn't exported if it's in the \nfuel supply tank of a vehicle or aircraft.\nIn a boat engaged in commercial fishing \n(No. 4). In a boat engaged in commercial fish-\ning means fuel used in taking, catching, pro-\ncessing, or transporting fish, shellfish, or other \naquatic life for commercial purposes, such as \nselling or processing the catch, on a specific trip \nbasis. They include boats used in both fresh \nand saltwater fishing. They don't include boats \nused for both sport fishing and commercial fish-\ning on the same trip.\nIn certain intercity and local buses (No. 5). \nIn certain intercity and local buses means fuel \nused in a bus engaged in furnishing (for com-\npensation) passenger land transportation avail-\nable to the general public. The bus must be en-\ngaged in one of the following activities.\n•\nScheduled transportation along regular \nroutes.\n•\nNonscheduled operations if the seating ca-\npacity of the bus is at least 20 adults, not \nincluding the driver. Vans and similar vehi-\ncles used for van-pooling or taxi service \ndon't qualify.\nAvailable to the general public. This means \nyou offer service to more than a limited number \nof persons or organizations. If a bus operator \nnormally provides charter operations through \ntravel agencies but has buses available for \nchartering by the general public, this service is \navailable to the general public. A bus doesn't \nqualify when its operator uses it to provide ex-\nclusive services to only one person, group, or \norganization. Also, intercity bus transportation \ndoesn't include transporting students and em-\nployees of schools or intercity transportation in \na qualified local bus.\nIn a qualified local bus (No. 6). In a qualified \nlocal bus means fuel used in a bus meeting all \nthe following requirements.\n•\nIt's engaged in furnishing (for compensa-\ntion) intracity passenger land transporta-\ntion available to the general public.\n•\nIt operates along scheduled, regular \nroutes.\n•\nIt has a seating capacity of at least 20 \nadults (excluding the driver).\n•\nIt's under contract with (or is receiving \nmore than a nominal subsidy from) any \nstate or local government to furnish the \ntransportation.\nIntracity passenger land transportation. \nThis is the land transportation of passengers \nbetween points located within the same metro-\npolitan area. It includes transportation along \nroutes that cross state, city, or county bounda-\nries if the routes remain within the metropolitan \narea.\nUnder contract. A bus is under contract with a \nstate or local government only if the contract im-\nposes a bona fide obligation on the bus opera-\ntor to furnish the transportation.\nMore than a nominal subsidy. A subsidy is \nmore than nominal if it's reasonably expected to \nexceed an amount equal to 3 cents multiplied \nby the number of gallons of fuel used in buses \non subsidized routes. A company that operates \nits buses along subsidized and unsubsidized in-\ntracity routes may consider its buses qualified \nlocal buses only when the buses are used on \nthe subsidized intracity routes.\nIn a school bus (No. 7). In a school bus \nmeans fuel used in a bus engaged in the trans-\nportation of students or employees of schools. \nA school is an educational organization with a \nregular faculty and curriculum and a regularly \nenrolled body of students who attend the place \nwhere the educational activities occur.\nFor diesel fuel and kerosene (other than \nkerosene used in aviation) used other than \nas a fuel (No. 8). Diesel fuel and kerosene \n(other than kerosene used in aviation) used \nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 2\nFuel Tax Credits and Refunds\n19\nother than as a fuel in the propulsion engine of a \ndiesel-powered highway vehicle or diesel-pow-\nered train (not including off-highway business \nuse) means undyed diesel fuel and undyed ker-\nosene used:\n•\nFor home heating, lighting, and cooking;\n•\nIn boats;\n•\nIn stationary machines, such as generators \nand compressors;\n•\nFor cleaning purposes; or\n•\nIn minibikes and snowmobiles.\nIn foreign trade (No. 9). In foreign trade \nmeans fuel used in civil aircraft employed in for-\neign trade or trade between the United States \nand any of its territories. The term trade in-\ncludes the transportation of persons or property \nfor hire and the making of the necessary prepa-\nrations for such transportation. In the case of \naircraft registered in a foreign country, the coun-\ntry must allow reciprocal benefits for aircraft reg-\nistered in the United States.\nCertain helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft \nuses (No. 10). Includes:\nCertain helicopter uses. Certain helicop-\nter uses means fuel used by a helicopter for any \nof the following purposes.\n1. Transporting individuals, equipment, or \nsupplies in the exploration for, or the de-\nvelopment or removal of, hard minerals, \noil, or gas.\n2. Planting, cultivating, cutting, transporting, \nor caring for trees (including logging oper-\nations).\n3. Providing emergency medical transporta-\ntion.\nDuring a use described in items (1) and (2), \nthe helicopter must not take off from, or land at, \na facility eligible for assistance under the Airport \nand Airway Development Act of 1970, or other-\nwise use services provided pursuant to section \n44509 or 44913(b) or subchapter I of chap-\nter 471 of title 49, United States Code.

Exclusive use by a \nqualified blood collector organization means \nfuel used by the qualified blood collector organi-\nzation for its exclusive use in the collection, stor-\nage, or transportation of blood.\nQualified blood collector organization. A \nqualified blood collector organization is one that \nis:\n•\nDescribed in section 501(c)(3) and exempt \nfrom tax under section 501(a),\n•\nPrimarily engaged in the activity of collect-\ning human blood,\n•\nRegistered by the IRS, and\n•\nRegistered by the Food and Drug Adminis-\ntration to collect blood.\nIn a highway vehicle owned by the United \nStates that isn't used on a highway (No. 12). \nIn a highway vehicle owned by the United \nStates that isn't used on a highway means fuel \nused in a vehicle that wasn't used on public \nhighways during the period covered by the \nclaim. This use applies whether or not the vehi-\ncle is registered or required to be registered for \nhighway use.\nExclusive use by a nonprofit educational \norganization (No. 13). Exclusive use by a \nnonprofit educational organization means fuel \nused by an organization exempt from income \ntax under section 501(a) that meets both of the \nfollowing requirements.\n•\nIt has a regular faculty and curriculum.\n•\nIt has a regularly enrolled body of students \nwho attend the place where the instruction \nnormally occurs.\nA nonprofit educational organization also in-\ncludes a school operated by a church or other \norganization described in section 501(c)(3) if \nthe school meets the above requirements.\nExclusive use by a state, political subdivi-\nsion of a state, or the District of Columbia \n(No. 14). Exclusive use by a state, political \nsubdivision of a state, or the District of Colum-\nbia means fuel purchased by the state or local \ngovernment for its exclusive use. A state or local \ngovernment is any state, any political subdivi-\nsion thereof, or the District of Columbia. An In-\ndian tribal government is treated as a state only \nif the fuel is used in an activity that involves the \nexercise of an essential tribal government func-\ntion. Gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene used \nby the American Red Cross is considered to be \nthe use of these fuels by a state.\nIn an aircraft or vehicle owned by an air-\ncraft museum (No. 15). In an aircraft or vehi-\ncle owned by an aircraft museum means fuel \nused in an aircraft or vehicle that is owned by an \norganization that meets all the following require-\nments.\n1.

To file a \nclaim, you must have a taxpayer identification \nnumber. Your taxpayer identification number \ncan be:\n•\nAn employer identification number (EIN);\n•\nA social security number (SSN); or\n•\nAn individual taxpayer identification num-\nber (ITIN), if you're an alien individual and \ndon't have and aren’t eligible to get an \nSSN.\nIf you normally file only a U.S. individual in-\ncome tax return (such as Form 1040 or \n1040-NR), use your SSN or ITIN. You get an \nSSN by filing Form SS-5, Application for a So-\ncial Security Card, with the Social Security Ad-\nministration. To get an ITIN, file Form W-7, Ap-\nplication \nfor \nIRS \nIndividual \nTaxpayer \nIdentification Number, with the IRS.\nIf you operate a business, use your EIN. If \nyou don't have an EIN, you may apply for one \nonline by going to IRS.gov/EIN. You may also \napply for an EIN by faxing or mailing Form SS-4, \nApplication for Employer Identification Number, \nto the IRS.\nClaiming a Refund\nGenerally, you may claim a refund of excise \ntaxes on Form 8849. Complete and attach to \nForm 8849 the appropriate Form 8849 sched-\nules. The Instructions for Form 8849 and the \nseparate instructions for each schedule explain \nthe requirements for making a claim for refund. \nIf you file Form 720, you can use the Form 720, \nSchedule C, for your refund claims for the quar-\nter. See the Instructions for Form 720. Don't \nclaim a refund on Form 8849 for any amount for \nwhich you have filed or will file a claim on Form \n720, Schedule C; Form 8864; or Form 4136.\nOnly one credit may be taken for each \namount of any fuel type.\nClaiming a Credit on Form \n4136\nA credit may be claimed for certain uses and \nsales of fuels on Form 4136 when you file your \nincome tax return at the end of the year. If you \nmeet certain requirements (discussed earlier), \nyou may be able to make a claim during the \nyear.\nCredit only. You can claim the following \ntaxes only as a credit on Form 4136.\n•\nTax on fuels used for nontaxable uses if the \ntotal for your tax year is less than $750.\n•\nTax on fuel you didn’t include in any claim \nfor refund previously filed for any quarter of \nyour tax year.\n•\nTax on fuel you used in mobile machinery \n(off-highway business use) that traveled \nless than 7,500 miles on public highways.\nOnly one credit may be taken for each \namount of any fuel type. Don't claim a credit for \nany amount for which you have filed a refund or \ncredit claim on Form 8849; 8864; or credit on \nForm 720, Schedule C.\nWhen to file. You can claim a fuel tax credit on \nyour income tax return for the year you used the \nfuel (or sold the fuel in the case of a registered \nultimate vendor claim).\nYou may be able to make a fuel tax \nclaim on an amended income tax re-\nturn for the year you used the fuel. \nGenerally, you must file an amended return by \nthe later of 3 years from the date you filed your \noriginal return or within 2 years from the date \nyou paid the income tax.\nHow to claim a credit. How you claim a credit \ndepends on whether you're an individual, part-\nnership, corporation, S corporation, or farmers' \ncooperative association.\nIndividuals. You claim the credit on Sched-\nule 3 (Form 1040), line 12. If you wouldn’t other-\nwise have to file an income tax return, you must \ndo so to get a fuel tax credit.\nPartnerships. Partnerships claim the credit \nby including a statement on Schedule K-1 \n(Form 1065), Partner's Share of Income, De-\nductions, Credits, etc., showing each partner's \nshare of the number of gallons of each fuel sold \nor used for a nontaxable use, the type of use, \nand the applicable credit per gallon. Each part-\nner claims the credit on their income tax return \nfor the partner's share of the fuel used by the \npartnership.\nOther entities. Corporations, S corpora-\ntions, farmers' cooperative associations, and \ntrusts must make the claim on the appropriate \nline of their applicable income tax return.\nFederal, state, and local governments, and \ncertain tax-exempt organizations (as discussed \nearlier, under Claiming A Refund) must use \nForm 8849, not Form 4136, to make an annual \nclaim.\nIncluding the Credit or \nRefund in Income\nIn most situations, the amount claimed \nas a credit or refund will be less than \nthe amount deducted as fuel tax ex-\npense because the LUST tax is generally not re-\nfunded. \nInclude any credit or refund of excise taxes \non fuels in your gross income if you claimed the \ntotal cost of the fuel (including the excise taxes) \nas an expense deduction that reduced your in-\ncome tax liability.\nThe year you include a credit or refund in \ngross income depends on whether you use the \ncash or an accrual method of accounting.\nCash method. If you use the cash method and \nfile a claim for refund, include the refund \namount in your gross income for the tax year in \nwhich you receive the refund. If you claim a \ncredit on your income tax return, include the \ncredit amount in gross income for the tax year in \nwhich you file Form 4136. If you file an amen-\nded return and claim a credit, include the credit \nTIP\nCAUTION\n!\namount in gross income for the tax year in \nwhich you receive the credit.\nExample 1. Sharon Brown, a cash basis \nfarmer, filed a 2024 Form 1040 on March 3, \n2025. On the Schedule F (Form 1040), Sharon \ndeducted the total cost of gasoline (including \n$110 of excise taxes) used on the farm. Then, \non Form 4136, Sharon claimed $108 as a \ncredit. Sharon reports the $108 as additional in-\ncome on the 2025 Schedule F (Form 1040).\nExample 2. March Corporation uses the \ncalendar year as its tax year. For 2024, the fol-\nlowing amounts of excise tax were included in \nthe cost of gasoline the corporation used each \nquarter in a nontaxable use.\nCalendar Quarters . . . .\nFuel Tax \nExpense\nFuel Tax \nClaim\nJan. 1 – March 31 . . . . . .\n$1,300\n$1,293\nApril 1 – June 30 . . . . . . .\n 1,100\n1,094\nJuly 1 – Sept. 30 . . . . . . .\n  400\n397\nOct. 1 – Dec. 31 . . . . . . .\n  300\n298\nTotal\n$3,100\n$3,082\nThe corporation deducts the entire cost of \nthe gasoline (including the $3,100 in excise \ntaxes) it used during the year as a business ex-\npense on its corporation income tax return, \nthereby reducing its corporate income tax liabil-\nity for that year.\nForm 8849. March Corporation files quar-\nterly refund claims for the first 2 quarters (end-\ning March 31 and June 30). It can't file a quar-\nterly refund claim for the third or fourth quarter \nbecause it didn’t meet the $750 minimum re-\nquirement.\nSince March Corporation uses the cash \nmethod of accounting, the corporation includes \n$2,387 ($1,293 + $1,094) in its gross income for \nthe tax year in which it receives the refunds \n(2024, for the purposes of this example).\nForm 4136. The corporation claims the re-\nmaining amounts ($397 + $298) as a credit on \nits 2024 income tax return by attaching Form \n4136. It files its tax return in 2025. It includes \nthis credit ($695) in its 2025 gross income.\nExample 3. Tyler S. Sands used undyed \ndiesel fuel in vehicles used in the construction \nbusiness. The vehicles weren’t registered (or re-\nquired to be registered) for highway use. In the \nfourth quarter of 2023 income tax year, which \nends in December, Tyler used 3,000 gallons of \nundyed diesel fuel. The excise tax on the 3,000 \ngallons of undyed diesel fuel used was $732 \n(tax of $0.244 per gallon).\nBecause the tax is less than $750, Tyler \nmust claim a credit for the tax on the 2023 in-\ncome tax return. Tyler fills out Form 4136 and \nattaches it to the 2023 income tax return, which \nTyler files in 2024. Tyler enters $729 (credit of \n$0.243 per gallon) on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), \nline 12.\nTyler uses the cash method of accounting. \nOn the 2023 Schedule C (Form 1040) Tyler de-\nducts the total cost of the fuel, including the tax. \nWhen Tyler files a 2024 Form 1040, it will in-\nclude the $729 credit shown on the 2023 Form \n22\nChapter 2\nFuel Tax Credits and Refunds\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\n4136 as additional income on the Schedule C \n(Form 1040) for 2024.\nFor the first 2 quarters of 2024, Tyler's re-\ncords show the following.\nClaim  \nClaim  \nQuarter\nGallons Used\nTax Rate\nAmount\nFirst\n 2,750\n0.243\n$668.25\nSecond\n 2,500\n0.243\n 607.50\nTyler couldn’t file a claim for a refund for the \nfirst quarter because the amount of the claim \nwas less than $750. Tyler adds the first quarter \namount ($668.25) to the second quarter \namount ($607.50) and claims a refund of \n$1,275.75 by filing Form 8849 and Schedule 1 \n(Form 8849). The claim must be filed by Sep-\ntember 30, 2024, which is the last day of the \nfirst quarter (July – September) following the \nlast quarter (April – June) included in the claim. \nTyler will have to include the $1,275.75 excise \ntax refund as additional income on a Sched-\nule C (Form 1040) for 2024 if he deducts the to-\ntal cost of the fuel, including the tax.\nAccrual method. If you use an accrual \nmethod, include the amount of credit or refund \nin gross income for the tax year in which you \nused the fuels (or sold the fuels if you're a regis-\ntered ultimate vendor). It doesn't matter whether \nyou filed for a quarterly refund or claimed the \nentire amount as a credit.\nExample 1. Patty Green uses an accrual \nmethod. Patty files a 2024 return in April 2025. \nOn Schedule C (Form 1040) Patty deducts the \ntotal cost of gasoline (including $155 of excise \ntaxes) used for an off-highway business use \nduring 2024. On Form 4136, Patty claims $153 \nas a credit. The $153 is reported as additional \nincome on the 2024 Schedule C (Form 1040).\nExample 2. Use the same facts as in the \nearlier Example 2, except that March Corpora-\ntion uses an accrual method of accounting. \nSince the nontaxable use occurred in 2024, the \ncorporation reports the $3,082 of excise tax re-\nfunds and credits as income on its 2024 income \ntax return. This consists of the $2,387 it claimed \non Form 8849 and the $695 it claimed on Form \n4136.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 2\nFuel Tax Credits and Refunds\n23\nPart Two.\nExcise Taxes \nOther Than Fuel \nTaxes\n3.\nEnvironmental \nTaxes\nEnvironmental taxes are imposed on domestic \ncrude oil and imported petroleum products (pe-\ntroleum tax), chemicals (other than ozone-de-\npleting chemicals (ODCs)), imported chemical \nsubstances, ODCs, and imported products con-\ntaining or manufactured with ODCs. In addition, \na floor stocks tax is imposed on ODCs held on \nJanuary 1 by any person (other than the manu-\nfacturer or importer of the ODCs) for sale or for \nuse in further manufacture.\nFigure the environmental tax on Form 6627. En-\nter the tax on the appropriate lines of Form 720 \nand attach Form 6627 to Form 720.\nFor environmental tax purposes, United States \nincludes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, \nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory \nof the United States, the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territory of \nthe Pacific Islands, the continental shelf areas \n(applying the principles of section 638), and for-\neign trade zones. No one is exempt from the en-\nvironmental taxes, including the federal govern-\nment, state and local governments, Indian tribal \ngovernments, and nonprofit educational organi-\nzations.\nTax on Petroleum\nThe petroleum tax is reported on Form 6627, \nand Form 720 (IRS Nos. 16, 18, 21, and 53). \nThe tax rate is the sum of the Oil Spill Liability \nTrust Fund financing rate (petroleum oil spill tax \nrate) and the Hazardous Substance Superfund \nfinancing rate (petroleum Superfund tax rate). \nThe petroleum oil spill tax rate is $0.09 per bar-\nrel. The petroleum Superfund tax rate is $0.17 \nper barrel, for both the 2024 and 2025 calendar \nyears, and will be adjusted annually for inflation. \nSee Form 6627 for the rates.\nGenerally, the petroleum tax is imposed on \ncrude oil received at a U.S. refinery and on pe-\ntroleum products entered into the United States \nfor consumption, use, or warehousing. The tax \nalso applies to certain uses of domestic crude \noil.\nCrude oil includes crude oil condensates \nand natural gasoline. Petroleum products in-\nclude crude oil, refined and residual oil, and \nother liquid hydrocarbon refinery products.\nCrude oil. Tax is imposed on crude oil when \nit’s received at a U.S. refinery. The operator of \nthe refinery is liable for the tax.\nTax is imposed on domestic crude oil that’s \nused before it's received at a U.S. refinery. How-\never, the use of crude oil for extracting oil or nat-\nural gas on the premises where such crude oil \nwas produced isn't taxable. The user is liable for \nthe tax.\nImported petroleum products. Tax is im-\nposed on petroleum products when they enter \nthe United States for consumption, use, or \nwarehousing. The person entering the petro-\nleum product into the country is liable for the \ntax, including the tax on imported crude oil, \neven if it's subsequently received at a U.S. refin-\nery.\nTax is imposed only once on any imported \npetroleum product. So, the operator of a U.S. \nrefinery that receives imported crude oil must \nestablish that they’re not liable for the tax by es-\ntablishing that the petroleum tax has already \nbeen imposed on the imported crude oil.\nTax on Chemicals (Other \nThan ODCs) and on \nImported Chemical \nSubstances\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act re-\ninstates the section 4661 excise tax on chemi-\ncals (other than ODCs) (IRS No. 54) and the",

Instead, mail the report to:\nDepartment of the Treasury\nInternal Revenue Service\nCincinnati, OH 45999\nCommunications Tax\nA 3% tax is imposed on amounts paid for local \ntelephone service and teletypewriter exchange \nservice.\nLocal telephone service. This includes ac-\ncess to a local telephone system and the privi-\nlege of telephonic quality communication with \nmost people who are part of the system. Local \ntelephone service also includes any facility or \nservices provided in connection with this serv-\nice. The tax applies to lease payments for cer-\ntain customer premises equipment (CPE) even \nthough the lessor doesn't also provide access \nto a local telecommunications system.\nLocal-only service. Local-only service is \nlocal telephone service as described above, \nprovided under a plan that doesn't include long \ndistance telephone service or that separately \nstates the charge for local service on the bill to \ncustomers. Local-only service also includes any \nfacility or services provided in connection with \nthis service, even though these services and fa-\ncilities may also be used with long-distance \nservice.\nPrivate communication service. Private \ncommunication service isn't local telephone \nservice. Private communication service in-\ncludes accessory-type services provided in \nconnection with a Centrex, PBX, or other similar \nsystem for dual use accessory equipment. \nHowever, the charge for the service must be \nstated separately from the charge for the basic \nsystem, and the accessory must function, in \nwhole or in part, in connection with intercommu-\nnication among the subscriber's stations.\nTeletypewriter exchange service. This in-\ncludes access from a teletypewriter or other \ndata station to a teletypewriter exchange sys-\ntem and the privilege of intercommunication by \nthat station with most persons having teletype-\nwriter or other data stations in the same ex-\nchange system.\nFiguring the tax. The tax is based on the sum \nof all charges for local telephone service inclu-\nded in the bill. However, if the bill groups individ-\nual items for billing and tax purposes, the tax is \nbased on the sum of the individual items within \nthat group. The tax on the remaining items not \nincluded in any group is based on the charge for \neach item separately. Don't include in the tax \nbase state or local sales or use taxes that are \nseparately stated on the taxpayer's bill.\nExemptions\nPayments for certain services or payments from \ncertain users are exempt from the communica-\ntions tax.\nNontaxable \nservice. Nontaxable \nservice \nmeans bundled service and long distance serv-\nice. Nontaxable service also includes pre-paid \ntelephone cards and pre-paid cellular service.\nBundled service. Bundled service is local \nand long distance service provided under a \nplan that doesn't separately state the charge for \nthe local telephone service. Bundled service in-\ncludes plans that provide both local and long \ndistance service for either a flat monthly fee or a \ncharge that varies with the elapsed transmis-\nsion time for which the service is used. Tele-\ncommunications companies provide bundled \nservice for both landlines and wireless (cellular) \nservice. If Voice over Internet Protocol service \nprovides both local and long distance service \nand the charges aren’t separately stated, such \nservice is bundled service.\n26\nChapter 4\nCommunications and Air Transportation Taxes\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nThe method for sending or receiving a call, \nsuch as on a landline telephone, wireless (cellu-\nlar), or some other method, doesn't affect \nwhether a service is local-only or bundled.\nLong distance service. Long distance \nservice is telephonic quality communication \nwith persons whose telephones are outside the \nlocal telephone system of the caller.\nPre-paid telephone cards (PTC). A PTC \nwill be treated as bundled service unless a PTC \nexpressly states it's for local-only service. Gen-\nerally, the person responsible for collecting the \ntax is the carrier who transfers the PTC to the \ntransferee. The transferee is the first person that \nisn't a carrier to whom a PTC is transferred by \nthe carrier. The transferee is the person liable \nfor the tax and is eligible to request a credit or \nrefund. For more information, see Regulations",

The tax doesn't apply to \npayments received for the installation of any in-\nstrument, wire, pole, switchboard, apparatus, or \nequipment. However, the tax does apply to pay-\nments for the repair or replacement of those \nitems incidental to ordinary maintenance.\nAnswering services. The tax doesn't apply to \namounts paid for a private line, an answering \nservice, and a one-way paging or message \nservice if they don’t provide access to a local \ntelephone system and the privilege of tele-\nphonic communication as part of the local tele-\nphone system.\nMobile radio telephone service. The tax \ndoesn't apply to payments for a two-way radio \nservice that doesn't provide access to a local \ntelephone system.\nCoin-operated telephones. The tax for local \ntelephone service doesn't apply to payments \nmade for services by inserting coins in public \ncoin-operated telephones. But the tax applies if \nthe coin-operated telephone service is fur-\nnished for a guaranteed amount. Figure the tax \non the amount paid under the guarantee plus \nany fixed monthly or other periodic charge.\nTelephone-operated security systems. The \ntax doesn't apply to amounts paid for tele-\nphones used only to originate calls to a limited \nnumber of telephone stations for security entry \ninto a building. In addition, the tax doesn't apply \nto any amounts paid for rented communication \nequipment used in the security system.\nNews services. The tax on teletypewriter ex-\nchange service doesn't apply to charges for the \nfollowing news services.\n•\nServices dealing exclusively with the col-\nlection or dissemination of news for or \nthrough the public press or radio or televi-\nsion broadcasting.\n•\nServices used exclusively in the collection \nor dissemination of news by a news ticker \nservice furnishing a general news service \nsimilar to that of the public press.\nThis exemption applies to payments received \nfor messages from one member of the news \nmedia to another member (or to or from their \nbona fide correspondents). For the exemption \nto apply, the charge for these services must be \nbilled in writing to the person paying for the \nservice and that person must certify in writing \nthat the services are used for an exempt pur-\npose.\nServices not exempted. The tax applies \nto amounts paid by members of the news media \nfor local telephone service.\nInternational organizations and the Ameri-\ncan Red Cross. The tax doesn't apply to com-\nmunication services furnished to an interna-\ntional organization or to the American National \nRed Cross.\nNonprofit hospitals. The tax doesn't apply to \ntelephone services furnished to income tax-ex-\nempt nonprofit hospitals for their use. Also, the \ntax doesn't apply to amounts paid by these hos-\npitals to provide local telephone service in the \nhomes of their personnel who must be reached \nduring their off-duty hours.\nNonprofit educational organizations. The \ntax doesn't apply to payments received for serv-\nices and facilities furnished to a nonprofit edu-\ncational organization for its use. A nonprofit ed-\nucational organization is one that satisfies all \nthe following requirements.\n•\nIt normally maintains a regular faculty and \ncurriculum.\n•\nIt normally has a regularly enrolled body of \npupils or students in attendance at the \nplace where its educational activities are \nregularly carried on.\n•\nIt's exempt from income tax under section \n501(a).\nThis includes a school operated by an organiza-\ntion exempt under section 501(c)(3) if the \nschool meets the above qualifications.\nQualified blood collector organizations. \nThe tax doesn't apply to telephone services fur-\nnished to qualified blood collector organizations \nfor their use. A qualified blood collector organi-\nzation is one that is:\n•\nDescribed in section 501(c)(3) and exempt \nfrom tax under section 501(a),\n•\nPrimarily engaged in the activity of collect-\ning human blood,\n•\nRegistered with the IRS, and\n•\nRegistered by the Food and Drug Adminis-\ntration to collect blood.\nFederal, state, and local government. The \ntax doesn't apply to communication services \nprovided to the government of the United \nStates, the government of any state or its politi-\ncal subdivisions, the District of Columbia, or the \nUnited Nations. Treat an Indian tribal govern-\nment as a state for the exemption from the com-\nmunications tax only if the services involve the \nexercise of an essential tribal government func-\ntion.\nExemption certificate. Any form of exemption \ncertificate will be acceptable if it includes all the \ninformation required by the Internal Revenue \nCode and Regulations. See Regulations section \n49.4253-11. File the certificate with the provider \nof the communication services. An exemption \ncertificate isn't required for nontaxable services.\nThe following users that are exempt from the \ncommunications tax don’t have to file an annual \nexemption certificate after they have filed the in-\nitial certificate to claim an exemption from the \ncommunications tax.\n•\nThe American National Red Cross and \nother international organizations.\n•\nNonprofit hospitals.\n•\nNonprofit educational organizations.\n•\nQualified blood collector organizations.\n•\nState and local governments.\nThe federal government doesn't have to file \nany exemption certificate.\nAll other organizations must furnish exemp-\ntion certificates when required.\nCredits or Refunds\nIf tax is collected and paid over for nontaxable \nservices, or for certain services or users exempt \nfrom the communications tax, the collector or \ntaxpayer may claim a credit or refund if it has re-\npaid the tax to the person from whom the tax \nwas collected or obtained the consent of that \nperson to the allowance of the credit or refund. \nAlternatively, the person who paid the tax may \nclaim a refund. For more information on how to \nfile for credits or refunds, see the Instructions for \nForm 720, or Form 8849.\nCollectors. The collector may request a credit \nor refund if it has repaid the tax to the person \nfrom whom the tax was collected, or obtained \nthe consent of that person to the allowance of \nthe credit or refund. These requirements also \napply to nontaxable service refunds.\nCollectors using the regular method for \ndeposits. Collectors using the regular method \nfor deposits must use Form 720-X to request a \ncredit or refund if the collector has repaid the \ntax to the person from whom the tax was collec-\nted, or obtained the consent of that person to \nthe allowance of the credit or refund.\nCollectors using the alternative method \nfor deposits.

For \nmore information, see the Instructions for Form \n720.\nAir Transportation Taxes\nTaxes are imposed on amounts paid for:\n•\nTransportation of persons by air,\n•\nUse of international air travel facilities, and\n•\nTransportation of property by air.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 4\nCommunications and Air Transportation Taxes\n27\nTransportation of\nPersons by Air\nThe tax on transportation of persons by air is \nmade up of the:\n•\nPercentage tax, and\n•\nDomestic-segment tax.\nPercentage tax. A tax of 7.5% applies to \namounts paid for taxable transportation of per-\nsons by air. Amounts paid for transportation in-\nclude charges for seat selection, premium \neconomy seating, online booking fee, layover or \nwaiting time, and movement of aircraft in dead-\nhead service.\nMileage awards. The percentage tax may \napply to an amount paid (in cash or in kind) to \nan air carrier (or any related person) for the right \nto provide mileage awards for, or other reduc-\ntions in the cost of, any transportation of per-\nsons by air. For example, this applies to mileage \nawards purchased by credit card companies, \ntelephone companies, restaurants, hotels, and \nother businesses.\nGenerally, the percentage tax doesn't apply \nto amounts paid for mileage awards where the \nmileage awards can't, under any circumstan-\nces, be redeemed for air transportation that is \nsubject to the tax. Until regulations are issued, \nthe following rules apply to mileage awards.\n•\nAmounts paid for mileage awards that can't \nbe redeemed for taxable transportation be-\nginning and ending in the United States \naren’t subject to the tax. For this rule, mile-\nage awards issued by a foreign air carrier \nare considered to be usable only on that \nforeign air carrier and not redeemable for \ntaxable transportation beginning and end-\ning in the United States. Therefore, \namounts paid to a foreign air carrier for \nmileage awards aren’t subject to the tax.\n•\nAmounts paid by an air carrier to a domes-\ntic air carrier for mileage awards that can \nbe redeemed for taxable transportation \naren’t subject to the tax to the extent those \nmiles will be awarded in connection with \nthe purchase of taxable transportation.\n•\nAmounts paid by an air carrier to a domes-\ntic air carrier for mileage awards that can \nbe redeemed for taxable transportation are \nsubject to the tax to the extent those miles \nwon’t be awarded in connection with the \npurchase of taxable transportation.\nDomestic-segment tax. The domestic-seg-\nment tax is a flat dollar amount for each seg-\nment of taxable transportation for which an \namount is paid. However, see Rural airports, \nlater. A segment is a single takeoff and a single \nlanding.\nNote. Generally, the tax on each domes-\ntic-segment of taxable air transportation increa-\nses annually based on adjustments for inflation. \nSee the Instructions for Form 720 for the tax \nrate.\nCharter flights. If an aircraft is chartered, \nthe domestic-segment tax for each segment of \ntaxable transportation is figured by multiplying \nthe tax by the number of passengers transpor-\nted on the aircraft.\nRural airports. The domestic-segment tax \ndoesn't apply to a segment to or from a rural air-\nport. An airport is a rural airport for a calendar \nyear if fewer than 100,000 commercial passen-\ngers departed from the airport by air during the \nsecond preceding calendar year (the 100,000 \npassenger rule), and one of the following is true:\n1. The airport isn't located within 75 miles of \nanother airport from which 100,000 or \nmore commercial passengers departed \nduring the second preceding calendar \nyear,\n2. The airport was receiving essential air \nservice subsidies as of August 5, 1997, or\n3. The airport isn't connected by paved roads \nto another airport.\nTo apply the 100,000 passenger rule to any \nairport described in (3) above, only count com-\nmercial passengers departing from the airport \nby air on flight segments of at least 100 miles.\nAn updated list of rural airports can be found \non the Bureau of Transportation Statistics web-\nsite \nat \nBTS.gov/Topics/Airlines-and-Airports/\nRural-Airports.\nTaxable transportation. Taxable transporta-\ntion is transportation by air that meets either of \nthe following tests.\n•\nIt begins and ends either in the United \nStates or at any place in Canada or Mexico \nnot more than 225 miles from the nearest \npoint on the continental U.S. boundary \n(this is the 225-mile zone).\n•\nIt's directly or indirectly from one port or \nstation in the United States to another port \nor station in the United States, but only if it \nisn't a part of uninterrupted international air \ntransportation.\nRound trip. A round trip is considered two \nseparate trips. The first trip is from the point of \ndeparture to the destination. The second trip is \nthe return trip from that destination.\nUninterrupted international air transpor-\ntation. This means transportation entirely by \nair that doesn't begin and end in the United \nStates or in the 225-mile zone if there isn't more \nthan a 12-hour scheduled interval between ar-\nrival and departure at any station in the United \nStates. For a special rule that applies to military \npersonnel, see Exemptions, later.\nTransportation between the continental \nUnited States and Alaska or Hawaii. This \ntransportation is partially exempt from the tax on \ntransportation of persons by air. The tax doesn't \napply to the part of the trip between the point at \nwhich the route of transportation leaves or en-\nters the continental United States (or a port or \nstation in the 225-mile zone) and the point at \nwhich it enters or leaves Hawaii or Alaska. \nLeaving or entering occurs when the route of \nthe transportation passes over either the U.S. \nborder or a point 3 nautical miles (3.45 statute \nmiles) from low tide on the coastline, or when it \nleaves a port or station in the 225-mile zone. \nTherefore, this transportation is subject to the \npercentage tax on the part of the trip in U.S. air-\nspace, the domestic-segment tax for each do-\nmestic segment, and the tax on the use of inter-\nnational air travel facilities.\nTransportation within Alaska or Hawaii. \nThe tax on transportation of persons by air ap-\nplies to the entire fare paid in the case of flights \nbetween any of the Hawaiian Islands, and be-\ntween any ports or stations in the Aleutian Is-\nlands or other ports or stations elsewhere in \nAlaska. The tax applies even though parts of \nthe flights may be over international waters or \nover Canada, if no point on the direct line of \ntransportation between the ports or stations is \nmore than 225 miles from the United States \n(Hawaii or Alaska).\nPackage tours. The air transportation taxes \napply to “complimentary” air transportation fur-\nnished solely to participants in package holiday \ntours. The amount paid for these package tours \nincludes a charge for air transportation even \nthough it may be advertised as “free.” This rule \nalso applies to the tax on the use of interna-\ntional air travel facilities.\nLiability for tax. The person paying for taxable \ntransportation is liable for the tax and, ordinarily, \nthe person receiving the payment collects the \ntax, files the returns, and pays the tax over to \nthe government. However, if payment is made \noutside the United States for a prepaid order, \nexchange order, or similar order, the person fur-\nnishing the initial transportation provided for un-\nder that order must collect the tax.\nA travel agency that is an independent \nbroker and sells tours on aircraft that it charters \nmust collect the transportation tax, file the re-\nturns, and pay the tax over to the government. \nHowever, a travel agency that sells tours as the \nagent of an airline must collect the tax and remit \nit to the airline for the filing of returns and for the \npayment of the tax over to the government. An \nindependent third party that isn't under the air-\nline's supervision or control, but is acting on be-\nhalf of, and receiving compensation from, a \npassenger, isn't required to collect the tax and \npay it to the government. For more information \non resellers of air transportation, see Revenue \nRuling \n2006-52 \nat \nIRS.gov/irb/\n2006-43_IRB#RR-2006-52.\nThe fact that the aircraft doesn't use public \nor commercial airports in taking off and landing \nhas no effect on the tax. But see Certain heli-\ncopter uses, later.\nFor taxable transportation that begins and \nends in the United States, the tax applies re-\ngardless of whether the payment is made in or \noutside the United States.\nIf the tax isn't paid when payment for the \ntransportation is made, the air carrier providing \nthe initial segment of the transportation that be-\ngins or ends in the United States becomes lia-\nble for the tax.\nExemptions. The tax on transportation of per-\nsons by air doesn't apply in the following situa-\ntions. See Special Rules on Transportation \nTaxes, later.\nMilitary personnel on international trips. \nWhen traveling in uniform at their own expense, \nU.S. military personnel on authorized leave are \ndeemed to be traveling in uninterrupted interna-\ntional air transportation even if the scheduled in-\nterval between arrival and departure at any sta-\ntion in the United States is actually more than \n12 hours. However, such personnel must buy \n28\nChapter 4\nCommunications and Air Transportation Taxes\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\ntheir tickets within 12 hours after landing at the \nfirst domestic airport and accept the first availa-\nble accommodation of the type called for by \ntheir tickets. The trip must begin or end outside \nthe United States and the 225-mile zone.\nCertain helicopter uses. The tax doesn't \napply to air transportation by helicopter if the \nhelicopter is used for any of the following purpo-\nses.\n1. Transporting individuals, equipment, or \nsupplies in the exploration for, or the de-\nvelopment or removal of, hard minerals, \noil, or gas.\n2. Planting, cultivating, cutting, transporting, \nor caring for trees (including logging oper-\nations).\n3. Providing emergency medical transporta-\ntion.\nHowever, during a use described in items (1) \nor (2), the tax applies if the helicopter takes off \nfrom, or lands at, a facility eligible for assistance \nunder the Airport and Airway Development Act \nof 1970, or otherwise uses services provided \nunder section 44509 or 44913(b) or subchapter \nI of chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code. \nFor item (1), treat each flight segment as a sep-\narate flight.\nFixed-wing aircraft uses. The tax doesn't \napply to air transportation by fixed-wing aircraft \nif the fixed-wing aircraft is used for any of the \nfollowing purposes.\n1. Planting, cultivating, cutting, transporting, \nor caring for trees (including logging oper-\nations).\n2. Providing emergency medical transporta-\ntion. The aircraft must be equipped for, \nand exclusively dedicated on that flight to, \nacute care emergency medical services.\n3. Providing emergency medical transporta-\ntion if the fixed-wing aircraft is equipped \nfor, and exclusively dedicated on that flight \nto, acute care emergency medical serv-\nices.\nHowever, during a use described in item (1), \nthe tax applies if the fixed-wing aircraft takes off \nfrom, or lands at, a facility eligible for assistance \nunder the Airport and Airway Development Act \nof 1970, or otherwise uses services provided \nunder section 44509 or 44913(b) or subchapter \nI of chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code.\nSkydiving. The tax doesn't apply to any air \ntransportation exclusively for the purpose of \nskydiving.\nSeaplanes. The tax doesn't apply to any air \ntransportation by seaplane for any segment \nconsisting of a takeoff from, and a landing on, \nwater if the places where the takeoff and land-\ning occur aren’t receiving financial assistance \nfrom the Airport and Airways Trust Fund.\nBonus tickets. The tax doesn't apply to \nfree bonus tickets issued by an airline company \nto its customers who have satisfied all require-\nments to qualify for the bonus tickets. However, \nthe tax applies to amounts paid by customers \nfor advance bonus tickets when customers \nhave traveled insufficient mileage to fully qualify \nfor the free advance bonus tickets.\nInternational\nAir Travel Facilities\nA tax per person is imposed (whether in or out-\nside the United States) for international flights \nthat begin or end in the United States. However, \nfor a domestic segment that begins or ends in \nAlaska or Hawaii, a reduced tax per person ap-\nplies only to departures. This tax doesn't apply \nif all the transportation is subject to the percent-\nage tax. It also doesn't apply if the surtax on fuel \nused in a fractional ownership program aircraft \nis imposed. See the Instructions for Form 720 \nfor the tax rates.\nNote. Generally, both the tax on the use of \ninternational air travel facilities for any interna-\ntional air transportation, if the transportation be-\ngins or ends in the United States, and the tax \nper person for domestic segments that begins \nor ends in Alaska or Hawaii (applies to depar-\ntures only), are increased annually based on in-\nflation adjustments. See the Instructions for \nForm 720 for the tax rate.\nTransportation of\nProperty by Air\nA tax of 6.25% is imposed on amounts paid \n(whether in or outside the United States) for \ntransportation of property by air. The fact that \nthe aircraft may not use public or commercial \nairports in taking off and landing has no effect \non the tax. The tax applies only to amounts paid \nto a person engaged in the business of trans-\nporting property by air for hire.\nThe tax applies only to transportation (in-\ncluding layover time and movement of aircraft in \ndeadhead service) that begins and ends in the \nUnited States. Thus, the tax doesn't apply to \ntransportation of property by air that begins or \nends outside the United States.\nExemptions. The tax on transportation of \nproperty by air doesn't apply in the following sit-\nuations. See Special Rules on Transportation \nTaxes, later.\nCropdusting and firefighting service. \nThe tax doesn't apply to amounts paid for crop-\ndusting or aerial firefighting service.\nExportation. The tax doesn't apply to pay-\nments for transportation of property by air in the \ncourse of exportation (including to U.S. territo-\nries) by continuous movement, as evidenced by \nthe execution of Form 1363, Export Exemption \nCertificate. See Form 1363 for more informa-\ntion.\nCertain helicopter and fixed-wing air am-\nbulance uses. The tax doesn't apply to \namounts paid for the use of helicopters in con-\nstruction to set heating and air conditioning \nunits on roofs of buildings, to dismantle tower \ncranes, and to aid in construction of power lines \nand ski lifts.\nThe tax also doesn't apply to air transporta-\ntion by helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft for the \npurpose of providing emergency medical serv-\nices. The fixed-wing aircraft must be equipped \nfor, and exclusively dedicated on that flight to, \nacute care emergency medical services.\nSkydiving. The tax doesn't apply to any air \ntransportation exclusively for the purpose of \nskydiving.\nExcess baggage. The tax doesn't apply to \nexcess baggage accompanying a passenger on \nan aircraft operated on an established line.\nSurtax on fuel used in a fractional own-\nership program aircraft. The tax doesn't ap-\nply if the surtax on fuel used in a fractional own-\nership program aircraft is imposed.\nAlaska and Hawaii. For transportation of \nproperty to and from Alaska and Hawaii, the tax \nin general doesn't apply to the portion of the \ntransportation that is entirely outside the conti-\nnental United States (or the 225-mile zone if the \naircraft departs from or arrives at an airport in \nthe 225-mile zone). But the tax applies to flights \nbetween ports or stations in Alaska and the \nAleutian Islands, as well as between ports or \nstations in Hawaii. The tax applies even though \nparts of the flights may be over international wa-\nters or over Canada, if no point on a line drawn \nfrom where the route of transportation leaves \nthe United States (Alaska) to where it reenters \nthe United States (Alaska) is more than 225 \nmiles from the United States.\nSeaplanes. The tax doesn't apply to any air \ntransportation by seaplane for any segment \nconsisting of a take off from, and a landing on, \nwater if the places where the take off and land-\ning occur aren’t receiving financial assistance \nfrom the Airport and Airways Trust Fund.\nLiability for tax. The person paying for taxable \ntransportation is liable for the tax and, ordinarily, \nthe person engaged in the business of trans-\nporting property by air for hire receives the pay-\nment, collects the tax, files the returns, and \npays the tax over to the government.\nIf tax isn't paid when a payment is made out-\nside the United States, the person furnishing \nthe last segment of taxable transportation col-\nlects the tax from the person to whom the prop-\nerty is delivered in the United States.\nSpecial Rules on\nTransportation Taxes\nAircraft used by affiliated corporations. The \ntaxes don’t apply to payments received by one \nmember of an affiliated group of corporations \nfrom another member for services furnished in \nconnection with the use of an aircraft. However, \nthe aircraft must be owned or leased by a mem-\nber of the affiliated group and can't be available \nfor hire by a nonmember of the affiliated group. \nDetermine whether an aircraft is available for \nhire by a nonmember of an affiliated group on a \nflight-by-flight basis.\nFor this rule, an affiliated group of corpora-\ntions is any group of corporations connected \nwith a common parent corporation through 80% \nor more of stock ownership.\nSmall aircraft. The taxes don’t apply to trans-\nportation furnished by an aircraft having a maxi-\nmum certificated takeoff weight of 6,000 \npounds or less. However, the taxes do apply if \nthe aircraft is operated on an established line. \nOperated on an established line means the air-\ncraft operates with some degree of regularity \nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 4\nCommunications and Air Transportation Taxes\n29\nbetween definite points. However, it doesn't in-\nclude any time an aircraft is being operated on a \nflight that is solely for sightseeing.\nConsider an aircraft to be operated on an \nestablished line if it's operated on a charter ba-\nsis between two cities also served by that car-\nrier on a regularly scheduled basis.\nAlso, the taxes apply if the aircraft is jet-pow-\nered, regardless of its maximum certificated \ntakeoff weight or whether or not it's operated on \nan established line.\nMixed load of persons and property. If a sin-\ngle amount is paid for air transportation of per-\nsons and property, the payment must be alloca-\nted between the amount subject to the tax on \ntransportation of persons and the amount sub-\nject to the tax on transportation of property. The \nallocation must be reasonable and supported \nby adequate records.\nCredits or refunds. If tax is collected and paid \nover for air transportation that isn't taxable air \ntransportation, the collector may claim a credit \nor refund if it has repaid the tax to the person \nfrom whom the tax was collected or obtained \nthe consent of that person to the allowance of \nthe credit or refund. Alternatively, the person \nwho paid the tax may claim a refund. For infor-\nmation on how to file for credits or refunds, see \nthe Instructions for Forms 720 or 8849.\nAircraft Management \nServices\nAmounts paid by an aircraft owner for certain \naircraft management services are exempt from \nthe section 4261 and 4271 excise taxes im-\nposed on transportation by air. An aircraft owner \nincludes a person that owns an aircraft and a \nperson that leases an aircraft for 31 days or \nmore. A person owns an aircraft if the person \nholds legal title to the aircraft, or if the person \nholds substantial incidents of ownership in the \naircraft for a period of more than 31 days. A les-\nsee of an aircraft includes the beneficiary of an \nowner trust that holds legal title to the aircraft.\nIf an aircraft owner pays an amount to an air-\ncraft management services provider for flights \non the aircraft owner's aircraft, the amount paid \nisn't subject to the section 4261 or 4271 excise \ntax, even if the aircraft owner isn’t on the flight. \nHowever, tax may apply if an aircraft owner \npays an amount to an aircraft management \nservices provider for flights on a substitute air-\ncraft. An allocation is required if an aircraft \nowner pays an amount to an aircraft manage-\nment services provider that includes an amount \nattributable to flights on the aircraft owner's air-\ncraft and an amount attributable to flights on a \nsubstitute aircraft.\nThe aircraft management services exemp-\ntion doesn’t apply to amounts paid by an aircraft \nowner for aircraft management services related \nto (i) an aircraft that the aircraft owner has \nleased for a period of less than 31 days, (ii) a \nfractionally owned aircraft, or (iii) an aircraft \nused for scheduled passenger service for which \ntickets are sold on a seat-by-seat basis to the \ngeneral public.\n5.\nManufacturers \nTaxes\nThe following discussion of manufacturers taxes \napplies to the tax on:\n•\nSport fishing equipment;\n•\nFishing rods and fishing poles;\n•\nElectric outboard motors;\n•\nFishing tackle boxes;\n•\nBows, quivers, broadheads, and points;\n•\nArrow shafts;\n•\nCoal;\n•\nTaxable tires;\n•\nGas guzzler automobiles; and\n•\nVaccines.\nManufacturer. The term “manufacturer” in-\ncludes a producer or importer. A manufacturer \nis any person who produces a taxable article \nfrom new or raw material, or from scrap, sal-\nvage, or junk material, by processing or chang-\ning the form of an article or by combining or as-\nsembling two or more articles. If you furnish the \nmaterials and keep title to those materials and \nto the finished article, you're considered the \nmanufacturer even though another person ac-\ntually manufactures the taxable article.\nA manufacturer who sells a taxable article in \nknockdown (unassembled) condition is liable \nfor the tax. The person who buys these compo-\nnent parts and assembles a taxable article may \nalso be liable for tax as a further manufacturer \ndepending on the labor, material, and overhead \nrequired to assemble the completed article if \nthe article is assembled for business use.\nImporter. An importer is a person who \nbrings a taxable article into the United States, or \nwithdraws a taxable article from a customs bon-\nded warehouse for sale or use in the United \nStates.\nSale. A sale is the transfer of the title to, or the \nsubstantial incidents of ownership in, an article \nto a buyer for consideration that may consist of \nmoney, services, or other things.\nUse considered sale. A manufacturer who \nuses a taxable article is liable for the tax in the \nsame manner as if it were sold.\nLease considered sale. The lease of an \narticle (including any renewal or extension of \nthe lease) by the manufacturer is generally con-\nsidered a taxable sale. However, for the gas \nguzzler tax, only the first lease (excluding any \nrenewal or extension) of the automobile by the \nmanufacturer is considered a sale.\nManufacturers taxes based on sale price. \nThe manufacturers taxes imposed on the sale \nof sport fishing equipment, electric outboard \nmotors, and bows are based on the sale price of \nthe article. The taxes imposed on coal are \nbased either on the sale price or the weight.\nThe price for which an article is sold in-\ncludes the total consideration paid for the arti-\ncle, whether that consideration is in the form of \nmoney, services, or other things. However, you \ninclude certain charges made when a taxable \narticle is sold and you exclude others. To figure \nthe price on which you base the tax, use the fol-\nlowing rules.\n1. Include both the following charges in the \nprice.\na. Any charge for coverings or contain-\ners (regardless of their nature).\nb. Any charge incident to placing the ar-\nticle in a condition packed ready for \nshipment.\n2. Exclude all the following amounts from \nthe price.\na. The manufacturers excise tax, \nwhether or not it's stated as a sepa-\nrate charge.\nb. The transportation charges pursuant \nto the sale. The cost of transportation \nof goods to a warehouse before their \nbona fide sale isn't excludable.\nc. Delivery, insurance, installation, retail \ndealer preparation charges, and other \ncharges you incur in placing the arti-\ncle in the hands of the purchaser un-\nder a bona fide sale. \nd. Discounts, rebates, and similar allow-\nances actually granted to the pur-\nchaser.\ne. Local advertising charges. A charge \nmade separately when the article is \nsold and that qualifies as a charge for \n“local advertising” may, within certain \nlimits, be excluded from the sale price.\nf. Charges for warranty paid at the pur-\nchaser's option. However, a charge for \na warranty of an article that the manu-\nfacturer requires the purchaser to pay \nto obtain the article is included in the \nsale price on which the tax is figured.\nBonus goods. Allocate the sale price if you \ngive free nontaxable goods with the purchase of \ntaxable merchandise. Figure the tax only on the \nsale price attributable to the taxable articles.\nExample. A manufacturer sells a quantity of \ntaxable articles and gives the purchaser certain \nnontaxable articles as a bonus. The sale price \nof the shipment is $1,500. The normal sale \nprice is $2,000: $1,500 for the taxable articles \nand $500 for the nontaxable articles. Since the \ntaxable items represent 75% of the normal sale \nprice, the tax is based on 75% of the actual sale \nprice, or $1,125 (75% of $1,500). The remaining \n$375 is allocated to the nontaxable articles.\nTaxable Event\nTax attaches when the title to the article sold \npasses from the manufacturer to the buyer. \nWhen the title passes depends on the intention \nof the parties as gathered from the contract of \nsale. In the absence of expressed intention, the \n30\nChapter 5\nManufacturers Taxes\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nlegal rules of presumption followed in the juris-\ndiction where the sale occurs determine when \ntitle passes.\nIf the taxable article is used by the manufac-\nturer, the tax attaches at the time use begins.\nThe manufacturer is liable for the tax.\nPartial payments. The tax applies to each par-\ntial payment received when taxable articles are:\n•\nLeased,\n•\nSold conditionally,\n•\nSold on installment with chattel mortgage, \nor\n•\nSold on installment with title to pass in the \nfuture.\nTo figure the tax, multiply the partial payment by \nthe tax rate in effect at the time of the payment.\nExemptions\nThe following sales by the manufacturer are ex-\nempt from the manufacturers tax.\n•\nSale of an article to a state or local govern-\nment for the exclusive use of the state or \nlocal government. This exemption doesn't \napply to the taxes on coal, gas guzzlers, \nand vaccines. “State” is defined in Defini-\ntions in chapter 1.\n•\nSale of an article to a nonprofit educational \norganization for its exclusive use. This ex-\nemption doesn't apply to the taxes on coal, \ngas guzzlers, and vaccines. “Nonprofit ed-\nucational organization” is defined under \nCommunications Tax in chapter 4.\n•\nSale of an article to a qualified blood col-\nlector organization. This exemption doesn't \napply to gas guzzlers, recreational equip-\nment, and vaccines. “Qualified blood col-\nlector organizations” are defined under \nCommunications Tax in chapter 4.\n•\nSale of an article for use by the purchaser \nas supplies for vessels. This exemption \ndoesn't apply to the taxes on coal and vac-\ncines. Supplies for vessels means ships' \nstores, sea stores, or legitimate equipment \non vessels of war of the United States or \nany foreign nation, vessels employed in the \nfisheries or whaling business, or vessels \nactually engaged in foreign trade.\n•\nSale of an article for use by the purchaser \nfor further manufacture, or for resale by the \npurchaser to a second purchaser for use \nby the second purchaser for further manu-\nfacture. This exemption doesn't apply to \nthe tax on coal and tires. Use for further \nmanufacture means use in the manufac-\nture or production of an article subject to \nthe manufacturers excise taxes. If you buy \narticles tax free and resell or use them \nother than in the manufacture of another \narticle, you're liable for the tax on their re-\nsale or use just as if you had manufactured \nand sold them.\n•\nSale of an article for export or for resale by \nthe purchaser to a second purchaser for \nexport. The article may be exported to a \nforeign country or to a territory of the Uni-\nted States. A vaccine shipped to a territory \nof the United States isn't considered to be \nexported. If an article is sold tax free for ex-\nport and the manufacturer doesn't receive \nproof of export, the manufacturer is liable \nfor the tax.\n•\nSales of articles of native Indian handicraft, \nsuch as bows and arrow shafts, manufac-\ntured by Indians on reservations, in Indian \nschools, or under U.S. jurisdiction in \nAlaska.\n•\nFor tire exemptions, see section 4221(e)\n(2).\nRequirements for Exempt \nSales\nThe following requirements must be met for a \nsale to be exempt from the manufacturers tax.\nRegistration \nrequirements. The \nmanufac-\nturer, first purchaser, and second purchaser in \nthe case of resales must be registered. See the \nForm 637 instructions for more information.\nExceptions to registration requirements. \nRegistration isn't required for:\n•\nState or local governments,\n•\nForeign purchasers of articles sold or re-\nsold for export,\n•\nThe U.S. Government, or\n•\nParties to a sale of supplies for vessels and \naircraft.\nCertification requirement. If the purchaser is \nrequired to be registered, the purchaser must \ngive the manufacturer its registration number \nand certify the exempt purpose for which the ar-\nticle will be used. The information must be in \nwriting and may be noted on the purchase order \nor other document furnished by the purchaser \nto the seller in connection with the sale.\nFor a sale to a state or local government, an \nexemption certificate must be signed by an offi-\ncer or employee authorized by the state or local \ngovernment. \nSee \nRegulations \nsection \n48.4221-5(c) for the certificate requirements.\nFor sales for use as supplies for vessels and \naircraft, if the manufacturer and purchaser \naren’t registered, the owner or agent of the ves-\nsel must provide an exemption certificate to the \nmanufacturer before or at the time of sale. See \nRegulations section 48.4221-4(d) for the certifi-\ncate requirements.\nProof \nof \nexport \nrequirement. Within \n6 \nmonths of the date of sale or shipment by the \nmanufacturer, whichever is earlier, the manufac-\nturer must receive proof of exportation. See \nRegulations section 48.4221-3(d) for evidence \nthat qualifies as proof of exportation.\nProof of resale for further manufacture re-\nquirement. Within 6 months of the date of sale \nor shipment by the manufacturer, whichever is \nearlier, the manufacturer must receive proof that \nthe article has been resold for use in further \nmanufacture. \nSee \nRegulations \nsection \n48.4221-2(c) for evidence that qualifies as proof \nof resale.\nInformation to be furnished to purchaser. \nThe manufacturer must indicate to the pur-\nchaser that the articles normally would be sub-\nject to tax and are being sold tax free for an ex-\nempt purpose because the purchaser has \nprovided the required certificate.\nCredits or Refunds\nThe manufacturer may be eligible to obtain a \ncredit or refund of the manufacturers tax for cer-\ntain uses, sales, exports, and price readjust-\nments. The claim must set forth in detail the \nfacts upon which the claim is based.\nUses, sales, and exports. A credit or refund \n(without interest) of the manufacturers taxes \nmay be allowable if a tax-paid article is, by any \nperson:\n•\nExported;\n•\nUsed or sold for use as supplies for ves-\nsels (except for coal and vaccines);\n•\nSold to a state or local government for its \nexclusive use (except for coal, gas guz-\nzlers, and vaccines);\n•\nSold to a nonprofit educational organiza-\ntion for its exclusive use (except for coal, \ngas guzzlers, and vaccines);\n•\nSold to a qualified blood collector organi-\nzation for its exclusive use (except for gas \nguzzlers, recreational equipment, and vac-\ncines); or\n•\nUsed for further manufacture of another ar-\nticle subject to the manufacturers taxes \n(except for coal).\nExport. If a tax-paid article is exported, the ex-\nporter or shipper may claim a credit or refund if \nthe manufacturer waives its right to claim the \ncredit or refund. In the case of a tax-paid article \nused to make another taxable article, the sub-\nsequent manufacturer may claim the credit or \nrefund.\nPrice readjustments. In addition, a credit or \nrefund (without interest) may be allowable for a \ntax-paid article for which the price is readjusted \nby reason of return or repossession of the arti-\ncle or a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance \nfor taxes based on price.\nConditions to allowance. To claim a credit or \nrefund in the case of export; supplies for ves-\nsels; or sales to a state or local government, \nnonprofit educational organization, or qualified \nblood collector organization, the person who \npaid the tax must certify on the claim that one of \nthe following applies and that the claimant has \nthe required supporting information.\n•\nThe claimant sold the article at a tax-exclu-\nded price.\n•\nThe person has repaid, or agreed to repay, \nthe tax to the ultimate vendor of the article.\n•\nThe person has obtained the written con-\nsent of the ultimate vendor to make the \nclaim.\nThe ultimate vendor is generally the seller mak-\ning the sale that gives rise to the overpayment \nof tax.\nClaim for further manufacture. To claim a \ncredit or refund for further manufacture, the \nclaimant must include a statement that contains \nthe following.\n•\nThe name and address of the manufac-\nturer and the date of payment.\n•\nAn identification of the article for which the \ncredit or refund is claimed.\n•\nThe amount of tax paid on the article and \nthe date on which it was paid.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 5\nManufacturers Taxes\n31\n•\nInformation indicating that the article was \nused as material in the manufacture or pro-\nduction of, or as a component part of, a \nsecond article manufactured or produced \nby the manufacturer, or was sold on or in \nconnection with, or with the sale of, a sec-\nond article manufactured or produced by \nthe manufacturer.\n•\nAn identification of the second article.\nFor claims by the exporter or shipper, the \nclaim must contain the proof of export and a \nstatement signed by the person that paid the \ntax waiving the right to claim a credit or refund. \nThe statement must include the amount of tax \npaid, the date of payment, and the office to \nwhich it was paid.\nClaim for price readjustment. To claim a \ncredit or refund for a price readjustment, the \nperson who paid the tax must include with the \nclaim a statement that contains the following.\n•\nA description of the circumstances that \ngave rise to the price readjustment.\n•\nAn identification of the article whose price \nwas readjusted.\n•\nThe price at which the article was sold.\n•\nThe amount of tax paid on the article and \nthe date on which it was paid.\n•\nThe name and address of the purchaser.\n•\nThe amount repaid to the purchaser or \ncredited to the purchaser's account.\nSport Fishing Equipment\nA tax of 10% of the sale price is imposed on \nmany articles of sport fishing equipment sold by \nthe manufacturer. This includes any parts or ac-\ncessories sold on or in connection with the sale \nof those articles.\nPay this tax with Form 720. No tax deposits \nare required.\nSport fishing equipment includes all the fol-\nlowing items.\n1. Fishing rods and poles (and component \nparts), fishing reels, fly fishing lines, other \nfishing lines not over the 130 pounds test, \nfishing spears, spear guns, and spear tips.\n2. Items of terminal tackle, including leaders, \nartificial lures, artificial baits, artificial flies, \nfishing hooks, bobbers, sinkers, snaps, \ndrayles, and swivels (but not including nat-\nural bait or any item of terminal tackle de-\nsigned for use and ordinarily used on fish-\ning lines not described in (1)).\n3. The following items of fishing supplies and \naccessories: fish stringers, creels, bags, \nbaskets, and other containers designed to \nhold fish, portable bait containers, fishing \nvests, landing nets, gaff hooks, fishing \nhook disgorgers, and dressing for fishing \nlines and artificial flies.\n4. Fishing tip-ups and tilts.\n5. Fishing rod belts, fishing rodholders, fish-\ning harnesses, fish fighting chairs, fishing \noutriggers, and fishing downriggers.\nSee Revenue Ruling 88-52 in Cumulative Bulle-\ntin 1988-1 for a more complete description of \nthe items of taxable equipment.\nFishing rods and fishing poles. The tax on \nfishing rods and fishing poles (and component \nparts) is 10% of the sales price not to exceed \n$10 per article. The tax is paid by the manufac-\nturer, producer, or importer.\nFishing tackle boxes. The tax on fishing \ntackle boxes is 3% of the sales price. The tax is \npaid by the manufacturer, producer, or importer.\nElectric outboard boat motors. A tax of 3% \nof the sale price is imposed on the sale by the \nmanufacturer of electric outboard motors. This \nincludes any parts or accessories sold on or in \nconnection with the sale of those articles.\nCertain equipment resale. The tax on the \nsale of sport fishing equipment is imposed a \nsecond time under the following circumstances. \nIf the manufacturer sells a taxable article to any \nperson, the manufacturer is liable for the tax. If \nthe purchaser or any other person then sells it \nto a person who is related (discussed next) to \nthe manufacturer, that related person is liable \nfor a second tax on any subsequent sale of the \narticle. The second tax, however, isn't imposed \nif the constructive sale price rules under section \n4216(b) apply to the sale by the manufacturer.\nIf the second tax is imposed, a credit for tax \npreviously paid by the manufacturer is available \nprovided the related person can document the \ntax paid. The documentation requirement is \ngenerally satisfied only through submission of \ncopies of actual records of the person that pre-\nviously paid the tax.\nRelated person. For the tax on sport fish-\ning equipment, a person is a related person of \nthe manufacturer if that person and the manu-\nfacturer have a relationship described in section \n465(b)(3)(C).\nBows, Quivers, \nBroadheads, and Points\nThe tax on bows is 11% of the sales price. The \ntax is paid by the manufacturer, producer, or im-\nporter. It applies to bows having a peak draw \nweight of 30 pounds or more. The tax is also im-\nposed on the sale of any part or accessory suit-\nable for inclusion in or attachment to a taxable \nbow and any quiver, broadhead, or point suita-\nble for use with arrows described below.\nPay this tax with Form 720. No tax deposits \nare required.\nArrow Shafts\nGenerally, the section 4161 tax on arrow shafts \nincreases annually based on inflation adjust-\nments. See Form 720 for the tax rate.

    "text": "Section 4121 imposes a tax on the first sale of \ncoal mined in the United States. The producer \nof the coal is liable for the tax. The producer is \nthe person who has vested ownership of the \ncoal under state law immediately after the coal \nis severed from the ground. Determine vested \nownership without regard to any contractual ar-\nrangement for the sale or other disposition of \nthe coal or the payment of any royalties be-\ntween the producer and third parties. A pro-\nducer includes any person who extracts coal \nfrom coal waste refuse piles (or from the silt \nwaste product that results from the wet washing \nof coal).\nThe tax isn't imposed on coal extracted from \na riverbed by dredging if it can be shown that \nthe coal has been taxed previously.\nTax rates. The tax on underground-mined coal \nis the lower of:\n•\n$1.10 a ton, or\n•\n4.4% of the sale price.\nThe tax on surface-mined coal is the lower \nof:\n•\n$0.55 a ton, or\n•\n4.4% of the sale price.\nCoal will be taxed at the 4.4% rate if the sell-\ning price is less than $25 a ton for under-\nground-mined coal and less than $12.50 a ton \nfor surface-mined coal. Apply the tax propor-\ntionately if a sale or use includes a portion of a \nton.\nExample. If you sell 21,000 pounds (10.5 \ntons) of coal from an underground mine for \n$525, the price per ton is $50. The tax is $1.10 \n× 10.5 tons ($11.55).\nCoal production. Coal is produced from sur-\nface mines if all geological matter (trees, earth, \nrock) above the coal is removed before the coal \nis mined. Treat coal removed by auger and coal \nreclaimed from coal waste refuse piles as pro-\nduced from a surface mine.\nTreat coal as produced from an underground \nmine when the coal isn't produced from a sur-\nface mine. In some cases, a single mine may \nyield coal from both surface mining and under-\nground mining. Determine if the coal is from a \nsurface mine or an underground mine for each \nton of coal produced and not on a mine-by-mine \nbasis.\n32\nChapter 5\nManufacturers Taxes\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nDetermining tonnage or selling price. The \nproducer pays the tax on coal at the time of sale \nor use. In figuring the selling price for applying \nthe tax, the point of sale is f.o.b. (free on board) \nmine or f.o.b. cleaning plant if you clean the coal \nbefore selling it. This applies even if you sell the \ncoal for a delivered price. The f.o.b. mine or \nf.o.b. cleaning plant is the point at which you fig-\nure the number of tons sold for applying the ap-\nplicable tonnage rate, and the point at which \nyou figure the sale price for applying the 4.4% \nrate.\nThe tax applies to the full amount of coal \nsold. However, the IRS allows a calculated re-\nduction of the taxable weight of the coal for the \nweight of the moisture in excess of the coal's in-\nherent moisture content. Include in the sale \nprice any additional charge for a freeze-condi-\ntioning additive in figuring the tax.\nDon't include in the sales price the excise \ntax imposed on coal.\nCoal used by the producer. The tax on coal \napplies if the coal is used by the producer in \nother than a mining process. A mining process \nmeans the same for this purpose as for percent-\nage depletion. For example, the tax doesn't ap-\nply if, before selling the coal, you break it, clean \nit, size it, or apply any other process considered \nmining under the rules for depletion. In this \ncase, the tax applies only when you sell the \ncoal. The tax doesn't apply to coal used as fuel \nin the coal drying process since it's considered \nto be used in a mining process. However, the \ntax does apply when you use the coal as fuel or \nas an ingredient in making coke since the coal \nisn't used in a mining process.\nYou must use a constructive sale price to fig-\nure the tax under the 4.4% rate if you use the \ncoal in other than a mining process. Base your \nconstructive sale price on sales of a like kind \nand grade of coal by you or other producers \nmade f.o.b. mine or cleaning plant. Normally, \nyou use the same constructive price used to fig-\nure your percentage depletion deduction.\nBlending. If you blend surface-mined coal with \nunderground-mined coal during the cleaning \nprocess, you must figure the excise tax on the \nsale of the blended, cleaned coal. Figure the tax \nseparately for each type of coal in the blend. \nBase the tax on the amount of each type in the \nblend if you can determine the proportion of \neach type of coal contained in the final blend. \nBase the tax on the ratio of each type originally \nput into the cleaning process if you can't deter-\nmine the proportion of each type of coal in the \nblend. However, the tax is limited to 4.4% of the \nsale price per ton of the blended coal.\nExemption from tax. The tax doesn't apply to \nsales of lignite and imported coal. The only \nother exemption from the tax on the sale of coal \nis for coal exported as discussed next.\nExported. The tax doesn't apply to the sale \nof coal if the coal is in the stream of export when \nsold by the producer and the coal is actually ex-\nported.\nCoal is in the stream of export when sold by \nthe producer if the sale is a step in the exporta-\ntion of the coal to its ultimate destination in a \nforeign country. For example, coal is in the \nstream of export when:\n1. The coal is loaded on an export vessel \nand title is transferred from the producer to \na foreign purchaser, or\n2. The producer sells the coal to an export \nbroker in the United States under terms of \na contract showing that the coal is to be \nshipped to a foreign country.\nProof of export includes any of the following \nitems.\n•\nA copy of the export bill of lading issued by \nthe delivering carrier.\n•\nA certificate signed by the export carrier's \nagent or representative showing actual ex-\nportation of the coal.\n•\nA certificate of landing signed by a cus-\ntoms officer of the foreign country to which \nthe coal is exported.\n•\nIf the foreign country doesn't have a cus-\ntoms administrator, a statement of the for-\neign consignee showing receipt of the \ncoal.\nTaxable Tires\nTaxable tires are divided into three cat-\negories for reporting and figuring the \ntax as described below.\nA tax is imposed on taxable tires sold by the \nmanufacturer, producer, or importer at the rate \nof $0.0945 ($0.04725 in the case of a biasply \ntire or super single tire) for each 10 pounds of \nthe maximum rated load capacity over 3,500 \npounds. The three categories for reporting the \ntax and the tax rate are listed below.\n•\nTaxable tires other than biasply or super \nsingle tires at $0.0945.\n•\nTaxable tires, biasply or super single tires \n(other than super single tires designed for \nsteering) at $0.04725.\n•\nTaxable tires, super single tires designed \nfor steering at $0.0945.\nA taxable tire is any tire of the type used on \nhighway vehicles if wholly or partially made of \nrubber and if marked according to federal regu-\nlations for highway use. A biasply tire is a pneu-\nmatic tire on which the ply cords that extend to \nthe beads are laid at alternate angles substan-\ntially less than 90 degrees to the centerline of \nthe tread. A super single tire is a tire greater \nthan 13 inches in cross section width designed \nto replace 2 tires in a dual fitment.\nSpecial rule, manufacturer's retail stores. \nThe excise tax on taxable tires is imposed at the \ntime the taxable tires are delivered to the manu-\nfacturer-owned retail stores, not at the time of \nsale.\nTires on imported articles. The importer of \nan article equipped with taxable tires is treated \nas the manufacturer of the tires and is liable for \nthe taxable tire excise tax when the article is \nsold (except in the case of an automobile bus \nchassis or body with tires).\nTires exempt from tax. The tax on taxable \ntires doesn't apply to the following items.\n•\nDomestically recapped or retreaded tires if \nthe tires have been sold previously in the \nCAUTION\n!\nUnited States and were taxable tires at the \ntime of sale.\n•\nTire carcasses not suitable for commercial \nuse.\n•\nTires for use on qualifying intercity, local, \nand school buses. For tax-free treatment, \nthe registration requirements discussed \nearlier under Requirements for Exempt \nSales, apply.\n•\nTires sold for the exclusive use of the De-\npartment of Defense or the Coast Guard.\n•\nTires of a type used exclusively on mobile \nmachinery. A taxable tire used on mobile \nmachinery isn't exempt from tax.\nQualifying intercity or local bus. This is \nany bus used mainly (more than 50%) to trans-\nport the general public for a fee and that either \noperates on a schedule along regular routes or \nseats at least 20 adults (excluding the driver).\nQualifying school bus. This is any bus \nsubstantially all the use (85% or more) of which \nis to transport students and employees of \nschools.\nCredit or refund. A credit or refund (without in-\nterest) is allowable on tax-paid tires if the tires \nhave been:\n•\nExported;\n•\nSold to a state or local government for its \nexclusive use;\n•\nSold to a nonprofit educational organiza-\ntion for its exclusive use;\n•\nSold to a qualified blood collector organi-\nzation for its exclusive use in connection \nwith a vehicle the organization certifies will \nbe primarily used in the collection, storage, \nor transportation of blood;\n•\nUsed or sold for use as supplies for ves-\nsels; or\n•\nSold in connection with qualified intercity, \nlocal, or school buses.\nAlso, a credit or refund (without interest) is \nallowable on tax-paid tires sold by any person \non, or in connection with, any other article that \nis sold or used in an activity listed above.\nThe person who paid the tax is eligible to \nmake the claim.\nGas Guzzler Tax\nTax is imposed on the sale by the manufacturer \nof automobiles of a model type that has a fuel \neconomy standard as measured by the EPA of \nless than 22.5 miles per gallon. If you import an \nautomobile for personal use, you may be liable \nfor this tax. Figure the tax on Form 6197, as dis-\ncussed later. The tax rate is based on fuel econ-\nomy rating. The tax rates for the gas guzzler tax \nare shown on Form 6197.\nA person that lengthens an existing automo-\nbile is the manufacturer of an automobile.\nAutomobiles. An automobile (including limou-\nsines) means any four-wheeled vehicle that is:\n•\nRated at an unloaded gross vehicle weight \nof 6,000 pounds or less,\n•\nPropelled by an engine powered by gaso-\nline or diesel fuel, and\n•\nIntended for use mainly on public streets, \nroads, and highways.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 5\nManufacturers Taxes\n33\nVehicles not subject to tax. For the gas \nguzzler tax, the following vehicles aren’t consid-\nered automobiles.\n1. Limousines with a gross unloaded vehicle \nweight of more than 6,000 pounds.\n2. Vehicles operated exclusively on a rail or \nrails.\n3. Vehicles sold for use and used primarily:\na. As ambulances or combination ambu-\nlance-hearses;\nb. For police or other law enforcement \npurposes by federal, state, or local \ngovernments; or\nc. For firefighting purposes.\n4. Vehicles treated under 49 U.S.C. 32901 \n(1978) as non-passenger automobiles. \nThis includes limousines manufactured \nprimarily to transport more than 10 per-\nsons.\nThe manufacturer can sell a vehicle descri-\nbed in item (3) tax free only when the sale is \nmade directly to a purchaser for the described \nemergency use and the manufacturer and pur-\nchaser (other than a state or local government) \nare registered.\nTreat an Indian tribal government as a state \nonly if the police or other law enforcement pur-\nposes are an essential tribal government func-\ntion.\nModel type. Model type is a particular class of \nautomobile as determined by EPA regulations.\nFuel economy. Fuel economy is the average \nnumber of miles an automobile travels on a gal-\nlon of gasoline (or diesel fuel) rounded to the \nnearest 0.1 mile as figured by the EPA.\nImported automobiles. The tax also ap-\nplies to automobiles that don’t have a proto-\ntype-based fuel economy rating assigned by the \nEPA. An automobile imported into the United \nStates without a certificate of conformity to U.S. \nemission standards and that has no assigned \nfuel economy rating must be either:\n•\nConverted by installation of emission con-\ntrols to conform in all material respects to \nan automobile already certified for sale in \nthe United States, or\n•\nModified by installation of emission control \ncomponents and individually tested to \ndemonstrate emission compliance.\nAn imported automobile that has been con-\nverted to conform to an automobile already cer-\ntified for sale in the United States may use the \nfuel economy rating assigned to that certified \nautomobile.\nA fuel economy rating isn't generally availa-\nble for modified imported automobiles because \nthe EPA doesn't require a highway fuel econ-\nomy test on them. A separate highway fuel \neconomy test would be required to devise a fuel \neconomy rating (otherwise the automobile is \npresumed to fall within the lowest fuel economy \nrating category).\nFor more information about fuel economy \nratings for imported automobiles, see Revenue \nRuling 86-20 and Revenue Procedure 86-9 in \nCumulative Bulletin 1986-1, and Revenue Pro-\ncedure 87-10 in Cumulative Bulletin 1987-1.\nExemptions. No one is exempt from the gas \nguzzler tax, including the federal government, \nstate and local governments, qualified blood \ncollector organizations, and nonprofit educa-\ntional organizations. However, see Vehicles not \nsubject to tax, earlier.\nForm 6197. Use Form 6197 to figure your tax \nliability for each quarter. Attach Form 6197 to \nyour Form 720 for the quarter. See the Form \n6197 instructions for more information and the \none-time filing rules.\nCredit or refund. If the manufacturer paid the \ntax on a vehicle that is used or resold for an \nemergency use, the manufacturer can claim a \ncredit or refund. For information about how to \nfile for credits or refunds, see the Instructions for \nForm 720 or Form 8849.\nVaccines\nTax is imposed on certain vaccines sold by the \nmanufacturer in the United States. A taxable \nvaccine means any of the following vaccines.\n•\nAny vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid.\n•\nAny vaccine containing tetanus toxoid.\n•\nAny vaccine containing pertussis bacteria, \nextracted or partial cell bacteria, or specific \npertussis antigens.\n•\nAny vaccine containing polio virus.\n•\nAny vaccine against measles.\n•\nAny vaccine against mumps.\n•\nAny vaccine against rubella.\n•\nAny vaccine against hepatitis A.\n•\nAny vaccine against hepatitis B.\n•\nAny vaccine against chicken pox.\n•\nAny vaccine against rotavirus gastroenteri-\ntis.\n•\nAny HIB vaccine.\n•\nAny conjugate vaccine against streptococ-\ncus pneumoniae.\n•\nAny trivalent vaccine against influenza or \nany other vaccine against influenza.\n•\nAny meningococcal vaccine.\n•\nAny vaccine against the human papilloma-\nvirus.\nThe effective date for the tax on any vaccine \nagainst influenza, other than trivalent influenza \nvaccines, is the later of August 1, 2013, or the \ndate the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-\nices lists a vaccine against seasonal influenza \nfor purposes of compensation for any vac-\ncine-related injury or death through the Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Trust Fund.\nThe tax is $0.75 per dose of each taxable \nvaccine. The tax per dose on a vaccine that \ncontains more than one taxable vaccine is \n$0.75 times the number of taxable vaccines.\nTaxable use. Any manufacturer (including a \ngovernmental entity) that uses a taxable vac-\ncine before it's sold will be liable for the tax in \nthe same manner as if the vaccine was sold by \nthe manufacturer.\nCredit or refund. A credit or refund (without in-\nterest) is available if the vaccine is:\n•\nReturned to the person who paid the tax \n(other than for resale), or\n•\nDestroyed.\nThe claim for a credit or refund must be filed \nwithin 6 months after the vaccine is returned or \ndestroyed.\nConditions to allowance. To claim a credit \nor refund, the person who paid the tax must \nhave repaid or agreed to repay the tax to the ul-\ntimate purchaser of the vaccine or obtained the \nwritten consent of such purchaser to allowance \nof the credit or refund.\n6.\nRetail Tax on\nHeavy Trucks,\nTrailers, and \nTractors\nA tax of 12% of the sales price is imposed on \nthe first retail sale of the following articles, in-\ncluding related parts and accessories sold on or \nin connection with, or with the sale of, the arti-\ncles.\n•\nTruck chassis and bodies.\n•\nTruck trailer and semitrailer chassis and \nbodies.\n•\nTractors of the kind chiefly used for high-\nway transportation in combination with a \ntrailer or semitrailer.\nA truck is a highway vehicle primarily designed \nto transport its load on the same chassis as the \nengine, even if it's equipped to tow a vehicle, \nsuch as a trailer or semitrailer.\nA tractor is a highway vehicle designed to tow a \nvehicle, such as a trailer or semitrailer. A tractor \nmay carry incidental items of cargo when towing \nor limited amounts of cargo when not towing.\nA sale of a truck, truck trailer, or semitrailer is \nconsidered a sale of a chassis and a body.\nThe seller is liable for the tax.\nChassis or body. A chassis or body is taxable \nonly if you sell it for use as a component part of \na highway vehicle that is a truck, truck trailer or \nsemitrailer, or a tractor of the kind chiefly used \nfor highway transportation in combination with a \ntrailer or semitrailer.\nHighway vehicle. A highway vehicle is any \nself-propelled vehicle designed to carry a load \nover public highways, whether or not it's also \ndesigned to perform other functions. Examples \nof vehicles designed to carry a load over public \nhighways are passenger automobiles, motorcy-\ncles, buses, and highway-type trucks and truck \ntractors. A vehicle is a highway vehicle even \nthough the vehicle's design allows it to perform \n34\nChapter 6\nRetail Tax on Heavy Trucks, Trailers, and Tractors\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\na highway transportation function for only one of \nthe following.\n•\nA particular type of load, such as passen-\ngers, furnishings, and personal effects (as \nin a house, office, or utility trailer).\n•\nA special kind of cargo, goods, supplies, or \nmaterials.\n•\nSome off-highway task unrelated to high-\nway transportation, except as discussed \nnext.\nVehicles not considered highway vehi-\ncles. Generally, the following kinds of vehicles \naren’t considered highway vehicles for purpo-\nses of the retail tax.\n1. Specially designed mobile machinery \nfor nontransportation functions. A \nself-propelled vehicle isn't a highway vehi-\ncle if all the following apply.\na. The chassis has permanently moun-\nted to it machinery or equipment used \nto perform certain operations (con-\nstruction, manufacturing, drilling, min-\ning, timbering, processing, farming, or \nsimilar operations) if the operation of \nthe machinery or equipment is unrela-\nted to transportation on or off the pub-\nlic highways.\nb. The chassis has been specially de-\nsigned to serve only as a mobile car-\nriage and mount (and power source, if \napplicable) for the machinery or \nequipment, whether or not the machi-\nnery or equipment is in operation.\nc. The chassis couldn’t, because of its \nspecial design and without substantial \nstructural modification, be used as \npart of a vehicle designed to carry any \nother load.\n2. Vehicles specially designed for \noff-highway transportation. A vehicle \nisn't treated as a highway vehicle if the ve-\nhicle is specially designed for the primary \nfunction of transporting a particular type of \nload other than over the public highway \nand because of this special design, the ve-\nhicles's capability to transport a load over \na public highway is substantially limited or \nimpaired.\nTo make this determination, you can \ntake into account the vehicle's size, \nwhether the vehicle is subject to licensing, \nsafety, or other requirements, and whether \nthe vehicle can transport a load at a sus-\ntained speed of at least 25 miles per hour. \nIt doesn't matter that the vehicle can carry \nheavier loads off highway than it's allowed \nto carry over the highway.\n3. Nontransportation trailers and\nsemitrailers. A trailer or semitrailer isn't \ntreated as a highway vehicle if it's specially \ndesigned to function only as an enclosed \nstationary shelter for carrying on a non-\ntransportation function at an off-highway \nsite. For example, a trailer that is capable \nonly of functioning as an office for an \noff-highway construction operation isn't a \nhighway vehicle.\nGross vehicle weight. The tax doesn't apply \nto truck chassis and bodies suitable for use with \na vehicle that has a gross vehicle weight of \n33,000 pounds or less. It also doesn't apply to \ntruck trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies \nsuitable for use with a trailer or semitrailer that \nhas a gross vehicle weight of 26,000 pounds or \nless. Tractors that have a gross vehicle weight \nof 19,500 pounds or less and a gross combined \nweight of 33,000 pounds or less are excluded \nfrom the 12% retail tax.\nThe following four classifications of truck \nbody types meet the suitable for use stand-\nard and will be excluded from the retail excise \ntax.\n•\nPlatform truck bodies 21 feet or less in \nlength.\n•\nDry freight and refrigerated truck van bod-\nies 24 feet or less in length.\n•\nDump truck bodies with load capacities of \n8 cubic yards or less.\n•\nRefuse packer truck bodies with load ca-\npacities of 20 cubic yards or less.\nFor more information on these classifications, \nsee \nRevenue \nProcedure \n2005-19, \nI.R.B. \n2005-14, \nat \nIRS.gov/irb/\n2005-14_IRB#RP-2005-19.\nThe gross vehicle weight means the maxi-\nmum total weight of a loaded vehicle. Generally, \nthis maximum total weight is the gross vehicle \nweight rating provided by the manufacturer or \ndetermined by the seller of the completed arti-\ncle. The seller's gross vehicle weight rating is \ndetermined solely on the basis of the strength of \nthe chassis frame and the axle capacity and \nplacement. The seller may not take into account \nany readily attachable components (such as \ntires or rim assemblies) in determining the gross \nvehicle weight.\nParts or accessories. The tax applies to parts \nor accessories sold on or in connection with, or \nwith the sale of, a taxable article. For example, if \nat the time of the sale by the retailer, the part or \naccessory has been ordered from the retailer, \nthe part or accessory will be considered as sold \nin connection with the sale of the vehicle. The \ntax applies in this case whether or not the re-\ntailer bills the parts or accessories separately.\nIf the retailer sells a taxable chassis, body, or \ntractor without parts or accessories considered \nessential for the operation or appearance of the \ntaxable article, the sale of the parts or accesso-\nries by the retailer to the purchaser is consid-\nered made in connection with the sale of the \ntaxable article even though they're shipped sep-\narately, at the same time, or on a different date. \nThe tax applies unless there is evidence to the \ncontrary. For example, if a retailer sells to any \nperson a chassis and the bumpers for the chas-\nsis, or sells a taxable tractor and the fifth wheel \nand attachments, the tax applies to the parts or \naccessories regardless of the method of billing \nor the time at which the shipments were made. \nThe tax doesn't apply to parts and accessories \nthat are spares or replacements.\nThe tax imposed on parts and accessories \nsold on or in connection with the taxable articles \nlisted earlier and the tax imposed on the sepa-\nrate purchase of parts and accessories for the \ntaxable articles listed earlier don’t apply to an \nidling reduction device or insulation that has an \nR value of at least R35 per inch.\nIdling reduction device. An idling reduc-\ntion device is any device or system of devices \nthat provide the tractor with services, such as \nheat, air conditioning, and electricity, without the \nuse of the main drive engine while the tractor is \ntemporarily parked or stationary. The device \nmust be affixed to the tractor and determined by \nthe Administrator of the EPA, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of \nTransportation, to reduce idling while parked or \nstationary. The EPA discusses idling reduction \ntechnologies on its website at EPA.gov/Verified-\nDiesel-Tech/Idling-Reduction-Technologies-\nIRTs-Trucks-and-School-Buses.\nSeparate purchase. The tax generally ap-\nplies to the price of a part or accessory and its \ninstallation if the following conditions are met.\n•\nThe owner, lessee, or operator of any vehi-\ncle that contains a taxable article installs \nany part or accessory on the vehicle.\n•\nThe installation occurs within 6 months af-\nter the vehicle is first placed in service.\nThe owners of the trade or business instal-\nling the parts or accessories are secondarily lia-\nble for the tax.\nA vehicle is placed in service on the date the \nowner takes actual possession of the vehicle. \nThis date is established by a signed delivery \nticket or other comparable document indicating \ndelivery to and acceptance by the owner.\nThe tax doesn't apply if the installed part or \naccessory is a replacement part or accessory. \nThe tax also doesn't apply if the total price of \nthe parts and accessories, including installation \ncharges, during the 6-month period is $1,000 or \nless. However, if the total price is more than \n$1,000, the tax applies to the cost of all parts \nand accessories (and installation charges) dur-\ning that period.\nExample. You bought a taxable vehicle and \nplaced it in service on April 8. On May 3, you \nbought and installed parts and accessories at a \ncost of $850. On July 15, you bought and instal-\nled parts and accessories for $300. Tax of $138 \n(12% of $1,150) applies on July 15. Also, tax \nwill apply to any costs of additional parts and \naccessories installed on the vehicle before Oc-\ntober 8.\nFirst retail sale defined. The sale of an article \nis treated as the first retail sale, and the seller \nwill be liable for the tax imposed on the sale un-\nless one of the following exceptions applies.\n•\nThere has been a prior taxable sale, lease, \nor use of the article (however, see Tax on \nresale of tax-paid trailers and semitrailers, \nlater).\n•\nThe sale qualifies as a tax-free sale under",

There is no regis-\ntration requirement.\nLeases. A long-term lease (a lease with a \nterm of 1 year or more, taking into account op-\ntions to renew) before a first retail sale is treated \nas a taxable sale. The tax is imposed on the les-\nsor at the time of the lease.\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 6\nRetail Tax on Heavy Trucks, Trailers, and Tractors\n35\nA short-term lease (a lease with a term of \nless than 1 year, taking into account options to \nrenew) before a first retail sale is treated as a \ntaxable use. The tax is imposed on the lessor at \nthe time of the lease.\nExported vehicle. A vehicle exported be-\nfore its first retail sale, used in a foreign country, \nand then returned to the United States is sub-\nject to the retail tax on its first domestic use or \nretail sale after importation.\nTax on resale of tax-paid trailers and \nsemitrailers. The tax applies to a trailer or \nsemitrailer resold within 6 months after having \nbeen sold in a taxable sale. The seller liable for \nthe tax on the resale can claim a credit equal to \nthe tax paid on the prior taxable sale. The credit \ncan't exceed the tax on the resale. See \nRegulations section 145.4052-1(a)(4) for infor-\nmation on the conditions to allowance for the \ncredit.\nUse treated as sale. If any person uses a \ntaxable article before the first retail sale of the \narticle, that person is liable for the tax as if the \narticle had been sold at retail by that person. \nFigure the tax on the price at which similar arti-\ncles are sold in the ordinary course of trade by \nretailers. The tax attaches when the use begins.\nIf the seller of an article regularly sells the ar-\nticles at retail in arm's-length transactions, fig-\nure the tax on its use on the lowest established \nretail price for the articles in effect at the time of \nthe taxable use.\nIf the seller of an article doesn't regularly sell \nthe articles at retail in arm's-length transactions, \na constructive price on which the tax is figured \nwill be determined by the IRS after considering \nthe selling practices and price structures of sell-\ners of similar articles.\nIf a seller of an article incurs liability for tax \non the use of the article and later sells or leases \nthe article in a transaction that otherwise would \nbe taxable, liability for tax isn't incurred on the \nlater sale or lease.\nPresumptive retail sales price. There are \nrules to ensure that the tax base of transactions \nconsidered to be taxable sales includes either \nan actual or presumed markup percentage. If \nthe person liable for tax is the vehicle's manu-\nfacturer, producer, or importer, the following dis-\ncussions show how you figure the presumptive \nretail sales price depending on the type of \ntransaction and the persons involved in the \ntransaction. Table 6-1 outlines the appropriate \ntax base calculation for various transactions.\nThe presumed markup percentage to be \nused for trucks and truck-tractors is 4%. But for \ntruck trailers and semitrailers and remanufac-\ntured trucks and tractors, the presumed markup \npercentage is zero.\nSale. For a taxable sale by a manufacturer, \nproducer, importer, or related person, you gen-\nerally figure the tax on a tax base of the sales \nprice plus an amount equal to the presumed \nmarkup percentage times that sales price.\nLong-term \nlease. In \nthe \ncase \nof \na \nlong-term lease by a manufacturer, producer, \nimporter, or related person, figure the tax on a \ntax base of the constructive sales price plus an \namount equal to the presumed markup percent-\nage times the constructive sales price.\nShort-term lease. When a manufacturer, \nproducer, importer, or related person leases an \narticle in a short-term lease considered a taxa-\nble use, figure the tax on a constructive sales \nprice at which those or similar articles are gen-\nerally sold in the ordinary course of trade by re-\ntailers.\nBut if the lessor in this situation regularly \nsells articles at retail in arm's-length transac-\ntions, figure the tax on the lowest established \nretail price in effect at the time of the taxable \nuse.\nIf a person other than the manufacturer, pro-\nducer, importer, or related person leases an ar-\nticle in a short-term lease considered a taxable \nuse, figure the tax on a tax base of the price for \nwhich the article was sold to the lessor plus the \ncost of parts and accessories installed by the \nlessor and a presumed markup percentage.\nRelated person. A related person is any \nmember of the same controlled group as the \nmanufacturer, producer, or importer. Don't treat \nas a related person a person that sells the arti-\ncles through a permanent retail establishment in \nthe normal course of being a retailer if that per-\nson has records to prove the article was sold for \na price that included a markup equal to or \ngreater than the presumed markup percentage.\nGeneral rule for sales by dealers to the con-\nsumer. For a taxable sale, other than a \nlong-term lease, by a person other than a man-\nufacturer, producer, importer, or related person, \nyour tax base is the retail sales price as dis-\ncussed next under Determination of tax base.\nWhen you sell an article to the consumer, \ngenerally you don’t add a presumed markup to \nthe tax base. However, you do add a markup if \nall the following apply.\n•\nYou don’t perform any significant activities \nrelating to the processing of the sale of a \ntaxable article.\n•\nThe main reason for processing the sale \nthrough you is to avoid or evade the pre-\nsumed markup.\n•\nYou don’t have records proving that the ar-\nticle was sold for a price that included a \nmarkup equal to or greater than the pre-\nsumed markup percentage.\nIn these situations, your tax base is the sales \nprice plus an amount equal to the presumed \nmarkup percentage times that selling price.\nDetermination of tax base. These rules apply \nto both normal retail sales price and presump-\ntive retail sales price computations. To arrive at \nthe tax base, the price is the total consideration \npaid (including trade-in allowance) for the item \nand includes any charge incident to placing the \narticle in a condition ready for use. However, \nsee Presumptive retail sales price, earlier.\nExclusions from tax base. Exclude from \nthe tax base the retail excise tax imposed on \nthe sale. Exclude any state or local retail sales \ntax if stated as a separate charge from the price \nwhether the sales tax is imposed on the seller \nor purchaser. Also exclude the value of any \nused component of the article furnished by the \nfirst user of the article.\nExclude charges for transportation, delivery, \ninsurance, and installation (other than installa-\ntion charges for parts and accessories, dis-\ncussed earlier) and other expenses incurred in \nconnection with the delivery of an article to a \npurchaser. These expenses are those incurred \nin delivery from the retail dealer to the customer. \nIn the case of delivery directly from the manu-\nfacturer to the dealer's customer, include the \ntransportation and delivery charges to the ex-\ntent the charges don't exceed what it would \nhave cost to ship the article to the dealer.\nExclude amounts charged for machinery or \nequipment that doesn't contribute to the high-\nway transportation function of the vehicle, provi-\nded those charges are supported by adequate \nrecords. For example, for an industrial vacuum \nloader vehicle, exclude amounts charged for the \nvacuum pump and hose, filter system, material \nseparator, silencer or muffler, control cabinet, \nand ladder. Similarly, for a sewer cleaning vehi-\ncle, exclude amounts charged for the high pres-\nsure water pump, hose components, and the \nvacuum pipe.\nSales not at arm's length. For any taxable \narticle sold (not at arm's length) at less than the \nfair market price, figure the excise tax on the \nprice for which similar articles are sold at retail \nin the ordinary course of trade.\nTable 6-1.

The \ntax \ndoesn't apply to the sale or use of an article that \nhas been repaired or modified unless the cost \nof the repairs and modifications is more than \n75% of the retail price of a comparable new arti-\ncle. This includes modifications that change the \ntransportation function of an article or restore a \nwrecked article to a functional condition. How-\never, this exception generally doesn't apply to \nan article that wasn't subject to the tax when it \nwas new.\nFurther manufacture. The tax doesn't ap-\nply to the use by a person of a taxable article as \nmaterial in the manufacture or production of, or \nas a component part of, another article to be \nmanufactured or produced by that person. Don't \ntreat a person as engaged in the manufacture of \nany article merely because that person com-\nbines the article with a:\n•\nCoupling device (including any fifth wheel);\n•\nWrecker crane;\n•\nLoading and unloading equipment (includ-\ning any crane, hoist, winch, or power lift-\ngate);\n•\nAerial ladder or tower;\n•\nIce and snow control equipment;\n•\nEarth moving, excavation, and construction \nequipment;\n•\nSpreader;\n•\nSleeper cab;\n•\nCab shield; or\n•\nWood or metal floor.\nCombining an article with an item in this list \ndoesn't give rise to taxability. However, see \nParts or accessories, earlier.\nArticles exempt from tax. The tax on heavy \ntrucks, trailers, and tractors doesn't apply to \nsales of the articles described in the following \ndiscussions.\nRail trailers and rail vans. This is any \nchassis or body of a trailer or semitrailer de-\nsigned for use both as a highway vehicle and a \nrailroad car (including any parts and accesso-\nries designed primarily for use on and in con-\nnection with it). Don't treat a piggyback trailer or \nsemitrailer as designed for use as a railroad car.\nParts and accessories. This is any part or \naccessory sold separately from the truck or \ntrailer, except as described earlier under Parts \nor accessories and Separate purchase.\nTrash containers. This is any box, con-\ntainer, receptacle, bin, or similar article that \nmeets all the following conditions.\n•\nIt's designed to be used as a trash con-\ntainer.\n•\nIt isn't designed to carry freight other than \ntrash.\n•\nIt isn't designed to be permanently moun-\nted on or affixed to a truck chassis or body.\nHouse trailers. This is any house trailer \n(regardless of size) suitable for use in connec-\ntion with either passenger automobiles or \ntrucks.\nCamper coaches or bodies for self-pro-\npelled mobile homes. This is any article de-\nsigned to be mounted or placed on trucks, truck \nchassis, or automobile chassis and to be used \nprimarily as living quarters or camping accom-\nmodations. Further, the tax doesn't apply to \nchassis specifically designed and constructed \nto accommodate and transport self-propelled \nmobile home bodies.\nFarm feed, seed, and fertilizer equip-\nment. This is any body primarily designed to \nprocess or prepare, haul, spread, load, or un-\nload feed, seed, or fertilizer to or on farms. This \nexemption applies only to the farm equipment \nbody (and parts and accessories) and not to the \nchassis upon which the farm equipment is \nmounted.\nAmbulances and hearses. This is any \nambulance, hearse, or combination ambu-\nlance-hearse.\nTruck-tractors. This is any truck-tractor \nspecifically designed for use in shifting semi-\ntrailers in and around freight yards and freight \nterminals.\nConcrete mixers. This is any article de-\nsigned to be placed or mounted on a truck, \ntruck trailer, or semitrailer chassis to be used to \nprocess or prepare concrete. This exemption \ndoesn't apply to the chassis on which the article \nis mounted.\nSales exempt from tax. The following sales \nare ordinarily exempt from tax.\n•\nSales to a state or local government for its \nexclusive use.\n•\nSales to Indian tribal governments, but only \nif the transaction involves the exercise of \nan essential tribal government function.\n•\nSales to a nonprofit educational organiza-\ntion for its exclusive use.\n•\nSales to a qualified blood collector organi-\nzation (as defined under Communications \nTax in chapter 4) for its exclusive use in the \ncollection, storage, or transportation of \nblood.\n•\nSales for use by the purchaser for further \nmanufacture of other taxable articles.\n•\nSales for export or for resale by the pur-\nchaser to a second purchaser for export.\n•\nSales to the United Nations for official use.\nRegistration requirement. In general, the \nseller and buyer must be registered for a sale to \nbe tax free. See the Form 637 instructions for \nmore information. Certain registration excep-\ntions apply in the case of sales to state and lo-\ncal governments, sales to foreign purchasers for \nexport, and sales for resale or long-term leas-\ning.\nFurther manufacture. If you buy articles \ntax free and resell or use them other than in the \nmanufacture of another article, you're liable for \nthe tax on their resale or use just as if you had \nmanufactured and made the first retail sale of \nthem.\nCredits or refunds. A credit or refund (without \ninterest) of the retail tax on the taxable articles \ndescribed earlier may be allowable if the tax has \nbeen paid with respect to an article and, before \nany other use, such article is used by any per-\nson as a component part of another taxable arti-\ncle manufactured or produced. The person us-\ning the article as a component part is eligible for \nthe credit or refund.\nA credit or refund is allowable if, before any \nother use, an article is, by any person:\n•\nExported,\n•\nUsed or sold for use as supplies for ves-\nsels,\n•\nSold to a state or local government for its \nexclusive use,\n•\nSold to a nonprofit educational organiza-\ntion for its exclusive use, or\n•\nSold to a qualified blood collector organi-\nzation for its exclusive use in the collection, \nstorage, or transportation of blood.\nA credit or refund is also allowable if there is a \nprice readjustment by reason of the return or re-\npossession of an article or by reason of a bona \nfide discount, rebate, or allowance.\nSee Conditions to allowance in chapter 5.\nTire credit. A credit is allowed against the re-\ntail tax on the taxable articles described earlier \nif taxable tires are sold on or in connection with \nthe sale of the article. The credit is equal to the \nmanufacturers excise tax imposed on the taxa-\nble tires. This is the section 4051(d) taxable tire \ncredit and is claimed on Form 720, Schedule C \nfor the same quarter for which the tax on the \nheavy vehicle is reported.\n7.\nShip Passenger \nTax\nA tax of $3 per passenger is imposed on certain \nship voyages, as explained later under Taxable \nsituations. The tax is imposed only once for \neach passenger, either at the time of first em-\nbarkation or disembarkation in the United \nStates.\nThe person providing the voyage (the operator \nof the vessel) is liable for the tax.\nVoyage. A voyage is the vessel's journey that \nincludes the outward and homeward trips or \npassages. The voyage starts when the vessel \nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 7\nShip Passenger Tax\n37\nbegins to load passengers and continues until \nthe vessel has completed at least one outward \nand one homeward passage. The tax may be \nimposed even if a passenger doesn't make both \nan outward and a homeward passage as long \nas the voyage begins or ends in the United \nStates.\nPassenger. A passenger is an individual car-\nried on the vessel other than the master or a \ncrew member or other individual engaged in the \nbusiness of the vessel or its owners.\nExample 1. John Smith works as a guest \nlecturer. The cruise line hired John for the bene-\nfit of the passengers. Therefore, John is en-\ngaged in the business of the vessel and isn't a \npassenger.\nExample 2. Marian Green is a travel agent. \nMarian is taking the cruise as a promotional trip \nto determine if it should be offered to the clients \nof the travel agency. Marian is a passenger.\nTaxable situations. There are two taxable sit-\nuations. The first situation involves voyages on \ncommercial passenger vessels extending over \none or more nights. A voyage extends over one \nor more nights if it extends for more than 24 \nhours. A passenger vessel is any vessel with \nstateroom or berth accommodations for more \nthan 16 passengers.\nThe second situation involves voyages on a \ncommercial vessel transporting passengers en-\ngaged in gambling on the vessel beyond the ter-\nritorial waters of the United States. Territorial \nwaters of the United States are those waters \nwithin the international boundary line between \nthe United States and any contiguous foreign \ncountry or within 3 nautical miles (3.45 statute \nmiles) from low tide on the coastline. If passen-\ngers participate as players in any policy game \nor other lottery, or any other game of chance for \nmoney or other thing of value that the owner or \noperator of the vessel (or their employee, agent, \nor franchisee) conducts, sponsors, or operates, \nthe voyage is subject to the ship passenger tax. \nThe tax applies regardless of the duration of the \nvoyage. A casual, friendly game of chance with \nother passengers that isn't conducted, spon-\nsored, or operated by the owner or operator \nisn't gambling for determining if the voyage is \nsubject to the ship passenger tax.\nExemptions. The tax doesn't apply when a \nvessel is on a voyage of less than 12 hours be-\ntween two points in the United States or if a ves-\nsel is owned or operated by a state or local gov-\nernment.\n8.\nForeign \nInsurance Taxes\nTax is imposed on insurance policies issued by \nforeign insurers. Any person who makes, signs, \nissues, or sells any of the documents and in-\nstruments subject to the tax, or for whose use or \nbenefit they're made, signed, issued, or sold, is \nliable for the tax.\nThe following tax rates apply to each dollar (or \nfraction thereof) of the premium paid.\n1. Casualty insurance and indemnity, fidelity, \nand surety bonds: $0.04. For example, on \na premium payment of $10.10, the tax is \n$0.44.\n2. Life, sickness, and accident insurance, \nand annuity contracts: $0.01. For example, \non a premium payment of $10.10, the tax \nis $0.11.\n3. Reinsurance policies covering any of the \ntaxable contracts described in items (1) \nand (2): $0.01.\nHowever, the tax doesn't apply to casualty in-\nsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers for \ncoverage of export goods in transit to foreign \ndestinations.\nPremium. Premium means the agreed \nprice or consideration for assuming and carry-\ning the risk or obligation. It includes any addi-\ntional charge or assessment payable under the \ncontract, whether in one sum or installments. If \npremiums are refunded, claim the tax paid on \nthose premiums as an overpayment against tax \ndue on other premiums paid or file a claim for \nrefund.\nWhen liability attaches. The liability for this \ntax attaches when the premium payment is \ntransferred to the foreign insurer or reinsurer (in-\ncluding transfers to any bank, trust fund, or simi-\nlar recipient designated by the foreign insurer or \nreinsurer) or to any nonresident agent, solicitor, \nor broker. A person can pay the tax before the \nliability attaches if the person keeps records \nconsistent with that practice.\nWho must file. The person who pays the pre-\nmium to the foreign insurer (or to any nonresi-\ndent person such as a foreign broker) must pay \nthe tax and file the return. Otherwise, any per-\nson who issued or sold the policy, or who is in-\nsured under the policy, is required to pay the tax \nand file the return.\nThe person liable for this tax must keep \naccurate records that identify each pol-\nicy or instrument subject to tax. These \nrecords must clearly establish the type of policy \nor instrument, the gross premium paid, the iden-\ntity of the insured and insurer, and the total pre-\nmium charged. If the premium is to be paid in in-\nstallments, the records must also establish the \nRECORDS\namount and anniversary date of each install-\nment.\nThe records must be kept at the place of \nbusiness or other convenient location for at \nleast 3 years after the later of the date any part \nof the tax became due, or the date any part of \nthe tax was paid. During this period, the records \nmust be readily accessible to the IRS.\nThe person having control or possession of \na policy or instrument subject to this tax must \nkeep the policy for at least 3 years after the date \nany part of the tax on it was paid.\nFor information on reinsurance premi-\nums paid from one foreign insurer to \nanother foreign insurer, see Revenue \nRuling 2008-15, I.R.B. 2008-12, at IRS.gov/irb/\n2008-12_IRB#RR-2008-15.\nTreaty-based positions under I.R.C 6114. \nYou may have to file an annual report disclosing \nthe amount of premiums exempt from U.S. ex-\ncise tax as a result of the application of a treaty \nwith the United States that overrides (or other-\nwise modifies) any provision of the Internal Rev-\nenue Code.\nAttach any disclosure statement to the first \nquarter Form 720. You may be able to use Form \n8833, Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure \nUnder Section 6114 or 7701(b), as a disclosure \nstatement. See the Instructions for Form 720 for \ninformation on how and where to file.\nSee Revenue Procedure 92-14 in Cumula-\ntive Bulletin 1992-1 for procedures you can use \nto claim a refund of this tax under certain U.S. \ntreaties.\n9.\nObligations Not\nin Registered \nForm\nTax is imposed on any person who issues a reg-\nistration-required obligation not in registered \nform. The tax is:\n•\n1% of the principal of the obligation, multi-\nplied by\n•\nThe number of calendar years (or portions \nof calendar years) during the period start-\ning on the date the obligation was issued \nand ending on the date it matures.\nA registration-required obligation is any obliga-\ntion other than one that meets any of the follow-\ning conditions.\n1. It's issued by a natural person.\n2. It isn't of a type offered to the public.\n3. It has a maturity (at issue) of not more than \n1 year.\n4. It's a tax-exempt bond.\nTIP\n38\nChapter 9\nObligations Not in Registered Form\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\n5. It's issued under an arrangement reasona-\nbly designed to ensure that the obligation \nwill be sold only to foreign persons.\nFor item (5), if the obligation isn't in registered \nform, the interest on the obligation must be pay-\nable only outside the United States and its terri-\ntories. Also, the obligation must state on its face \nthat any U.S. person who holds it shall be sub-\nject to limits under the U.S. income tax laws.\n10.\nIndoor Tanning \nServices Tax\nThe tax on indoor tanning service is 10% of the \namount paid for that service. The tax is paid by \nthe person paying for the services and is collec-\nted by the person receiving payment for the in-\ndoor tanning services.\nDefinition of indoor tanning services. In-\ndoor tanning service means a service employ-\ning any electronic product designed to incorpo-\nrate one or more ultraviolet lamps and intended \nfor the irradiation of an individual by ultraviolet \nradiation, with wavelengths in air between 200 \nand 400 nanometers, to induce skin tanning. \nThe term doesn't include phototherapy service \nperformed by, and on the premises of, a li-\ncensed medical professional (such as a derma-\ntologist, psychologist, or registered nurse). See \nRegulations section 49.5000B-1 (indoor tanning \nservices) for more information, and special \nrules for qualified physical fitness facilities, un-\ndesignated payment cards, and bundled pay-\nments.\nFile Form 720. The person receiving the pay-\nment for indoor tanning services (collector) \nmust collect and remit the tax and file the return. \nIf the tax isn't collected for any reason, the col-\nlector is liable for the tax. The collector isn't re-\nquired to make semimonthly deposits of the tax.\n11.\nPatient-Centered \nOutcomes \nResearch Fee\nThe patient-centered outcomes research fee is \nimposed on issuers of specified health insur-\nance policies (section 4375) and plan sponsors \nof applicable self-insured health plans (section \n4376) for policy and plan years ending on or af-\nter October 1, 2012. Generally, references to \ntaxes on Form 720 include this fee.\nSpecified health insurance policies.  See \nthe Instructions for Form 720 revised for the \nsecond quarter of each year for information on \nthe fee amount. Generally, issuers of specified \nhealth insurance polices must use one of the \nfollowing four alternative methods to determine \nthe average number of lives covered under a \npolicy for the policy year.\n1. The actual count method.\n2. The snapshot method.\n3. The member months method.\n4. The state form method.\nApplicable self-insured health plans. See \nthe Instructions for Form 720 revised for the \nsecond quarter of each year for information on \nthe fee amount. Generally, plan sponsors of ap-\nplicable self-insured health plans must use one \nof the following three alternative methods to de-\ntermine the average number of lives covered \nunder a plan for the plan year.\n1. Actual count method.\n2. Snapshot method.\n3. Form 5500 method.\nReporting and paying the fee. File Form 720 \nannually to report and pay the fee on the sec-\nond quarter Form 720 no later than July 31 of \nthe calendar year immediately following the last \nday of the policy year or plan year to which the \nfee applies. If you file Form 720 only to report \nthe fee, don’t file Form 720 for the first, third, or \nfourth quarters of the year. If you file Form 720 \nto report quarterly excise tax liability for the first, \nthird, or fourth quarter of the year (for example, \nfilers reporting the foreign insurance tax (IRS \nNo. 30)), don’t make an entry on the line for IRS \nNo. 133 on those filings.\nDeposits aren’t required for this fee, so issu-\ners and plan sponsors aren’t required to pay the \nfee using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment \nSystem (EFTPS).\nHowever, if the fee is paid using EFTPS, the \npayment should be applied to the second quar-\nter. See Electronic deposit requirement under \nHow To Make Deposits in chapter 14, later.\nMore information. For more information, in-\ncluding methods for calculating the average \nnumber of lives covered, see the Instructions for \nForm 720; sections 4375, 4376, 4377; and Reg-\nulations section 46.4375-1.

See Alter-\nnative method (IRS Nos. 22, 26, 27, and 28), \nlater.\nIf you're depositing more than one tax under \na method, combine all the taxes under the \nmethod and make one deposit for the semi-\nmonthly period.\nRegular method. The deposit of tax for a sem-\nimonthly period is due by the 14th day following \nthat period. Generally, this is the 29th day of a \nmonth for the first semimonthly period and the \n14th day of the following month for the second \nsemimonthly period. If the 14th or the 29th day \nfalls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you \nmust make the deposit by the immediately pre-\nTIP\nceding day that isn't a Saturday, Sunday, or le-\ngal holiday.\nAlternative method (IRS Nos. 22, 26, 27, \nand 28). Deposits of communications and air \ntransportation taxes may be based on taxes in-\ncluded in amounts billed or tickets sold during a \nsemimonthly period instead of on taxes actually \ncollected during the period. Under the alterna-\ntive method, the tax included in amounts billed \nor tickets sold during a semimonthly period is \nconsidered collected during the first 7 days of \nthe second following semimonthly period. The \ndeposit of tax is due by the third banking day af-\nter the seventh day of that period.\nFor an example of the alternative method, \nsee the Instructions for Form 720.\nTo use the alternative method, you must \nkeep a separate account of the tax included in \namounts billed or tickets sold during the month \nand report on Form 720 the tax included in \namounts billed or tickets sold and not the \namount of tax that is actually collected. For ex-\nample, amounts billed in December, January, \nand February are considered collected during \nJanuary, February, and March and are reported \non Form 720 as the tax for the first quarter of \nthe calendar year.\nThe separate account for each month must \nreflect:\n1. All items of tax included in amounts billed \nor tickets sold during the month, and\n2. Other items of adjustment relating to tax \nfor prior months (within the statute of limi-\ntations on credits or refunds).\nThe separate account for any month can't in-\nclude an adjustment resulting from a refusal to \npay or inability to collect unless the refusal has \nbeen reported to the IRS. See Uncollected Tax \nReport in chapter 4.\nThe net amount of tax that is considered col-\nlected during the semimonthly period must be \neither:\n•\nThe net amount of tax reflected in the sep-\narate account for the corresponding semi-\nmonthly period of the preceding month, or\n•\nOne-half of the net amount of tax reflected \nin the separate account for the preceding \nmonth.\nSpecial rule for deposits of taxes in Sep-\ntember. See the Instructions for Form 720 for a \nspecial rule on deposits made in September.\nAmount of Deposits\nDeposits for a semimonthly period must gener-\nally be at least 95% of the net tax liability for that \nperiod unless the safe harbor rule applies. Gen-\nerally, you don't have to make a deposit for a pe-\nriod in which you incurred no tax liability.\nNet tax liability. Your net tax liability is your tax \nliability for the period minus any claims on Form \n720, Schedule C for the period. You may figure \nyour net tax liability for a semimonthly period by \ndividing your net liability incurred during the cal-\nendar month by two. If you use this method, you \nmust use it for all semimonthly periods in the \ncalendar quarter.\nDon't reduce your liability by any \namounts from Form 720-X.\nSafe Harbor Rule\nThe safe harbor rule applies separately to de-\nposits under the regular method and the alter-\nnative method. Persons who filed Form 720 for \nthe look-back quarter (the second calendar \nquarter preceding the current quarter) are con-\nsidered to meet the semimonthly deposit re-\nquirement if the deposit for each semimonthly \nperiod in the current quarter is at least 1/6 \n(16.67%) of the net tax liability reported for the \nlook-back quarter.\nFor the semimonthly period for which the ad-\nditional deposit is required, the additional de-\nposit must be at least 11/90 (12.23%), 10/90 \n(11.12%) for non-EFTPS, of the net tax liability \nreported for the look-back quarter. Also, the to-\ntal deposit for that semimonthly period must be \nat least 1/6 (16.67%) of the net tax liability re-\nported for the look-back quarter.\nExceptions. The safe harbor rule doesn't \napply to:\n•\nThe first and second quarters beginning on \nor after the effective date of an increase in \nthe rate of tax unless the deposit of taxes \nfor each semimonthly period in the calen-\ndar quarter is at least 1/6 (16.67%) of the \ntax liability you would have had for the \nlook-back quarter if the increased rate of \ntax had been in effect for that look-back \nquarter;\n•\nAny quarter if liability includes any tax not \nin effect throughout the look-back quarter; \nor\n•\nFor deposits under the alternative method, \nany quarter if liability includes any tax not \nin effect throughout the look-back quarter \nand the month preceding the look-back \nquarter.\nRequirements to be met. For the safe harbor \nrule to apply, you must:\n•\nMake each deposit timely at an authorized \nfinancial institution, and\n•\nPay any underpayment for the current \nquarter by the due date of the return.\nThe IRS may withdraw the right to \nmake deposits of tax using the safe \nharbor rule from any person not com-\nplying with these rules.\nTax rate increases. You must modify the safe \nharbor rule if there has been an increase in the \nrate of tax. You must figure your tax liability in \nthe look-back quarter as if the increased rate \nhad been in effect. To qualify for the safe harbor \nrule, your deposits can't be less than 1/6 of the \nrefigured tax liability.\nCAUTION\n!\nCAUTION\n!\nPublication 510 (3-2025)\nChapter 14\nPayment of Taxes\n41\n15.\nPenalties\nand Interest\nPenalties and interest may result from any of the \nfollowing acts.\n•\nFailing to collect and pay over tax as the \ncollecting agent (see Trust fund recovery \npenalty, later).\n•\nFailing to keep adequate records.\n•\nFailing to file returns.\n•\nFailing to pay taxes.\n•\nFiling returns late.\n•\nFiling false or fraudulent returns.\n•\nPaying taxes late.\n•\nFailing to make deposits.\n•\nDepositing taxes late.\n•\nMaking false statements relating to tax.\n•\nFailing to register or reregister.\n•\nMisrepresenting that tax is excluded from \nthe price of an article.\nFailure to register or reregister. The civil \npenalty for failure to register or reregister if \nyou're required to register or reregister, unless \ndue to reasonable cause, is $10,000 for the ini-\ntial failure, and then $1,000 each day thereafter \nyou fail to register or reregister.\nClaims. There are criminal penalties for false \nor fraudulent claims. In addition, any person \nwho files a refund claim with respect to the use \nof certain fuels for an excessive amount (with-\nout reasonable cause) may have to pay a civil \npenalty. An excessive amount is the amount \nclaimed that is more than the allowable amount. \nThe penalty is the greater of two times the ex-\ncessive amount or $10.\nTrust fund recovery penalty. If you provide \ntaxable communications, air transportation \nservices, or indoor tanning services, you have \nto collect excise taxes from those persons who \npay you for those services. You must pay over \nthese taxes to the U.S. Government.\nIf you willfully fail to collect or pay over these \ntaxes, or if you evade or defeat them in any way, \nthe trust fund recovery penalty may apply. Will-\nfully means voluntarily, consciously, and inten-\ntionally. The trust fund recovery penalty equals \n100% of the taxes not collected or not paid over \nto the U.S. Government.\nThe trust fund recovery penalty may be im-\nposed on any person responsible for collecting, \naccounting for, and paying over these taxes. If \nthis person knows that these required actions \naren’t taking place for whatever reason, the per-\nson is acting willfully. Paying other expenses of \nthe business instead of paying the taxes is will-\nful behavior.\nA responsible person can be an officer or \nemployee of a corporation, a partner or em-\nployee of a partnership, or any other person \nwho had responsibility for certain aspects of the \nbusiness and financial affairs of the employer \n(or business). This may include accountants, \ntrustees in bankruptcy, members of a board, \nbanks, insurance companies, or sureties. The \nresponsible person could even be another cor-\nporation—in other words, anyone who has the \nduty and the ability to direct, account for, or pay \nover the money. Having signature power on the \nbusiness checking account could be a signifi-\ncant factor in determining responsibility.\n16.\nExamination and\nAppeal \nProcedures\nIf your excise tax return is examined and you \ndisagree with the findings, you can get informa-\ntion about audit and appeal procedures from \nPublication 556, Examination of Returns, Ap-\npeal Rights, and Claims for Refund. An un-\nagreed case involving an excise tax covered in \nthis publication differs from other tax cases in \nthat you can only contest it in court after pay-\nment of the tax by filing suit for a refund in the \nUnited States District Court or the United States \nCourt of Federal Claims.\n17.\nRulings Program\nThe IRS has a program for assisting taxpayers \nwho have technical problems with tax laws and \nregulations. The IRS will answer inquiries from \nindividuals and organizations about the tax ef-\nfect of their acts or transactions. The National \nOffice of the IRS issues rulings on those mat-\nters.\nA ruling is a written statement to a taxpayer that \ninterprets and applies tax laws to the taxpayer's \nspecific set of facts. There are also determina-\ntion letters issued by IRS directors and informa-\ntion letters issued by IRS directors or the Na-\ntional Office.\nThere is a fee for most types of determination \nletters and rulings. For complete information on \nthe rulings program, see the first Internal Reve-\nnue Bulletin published each year.\n18.\nHow To Get Tax \nHelp\nIf you have questions about a tax issue; need \nhelp preparing your tax return; or want to down-\nload free publications, forms, or instructions, go \nto IRS.gov to find resources that can help you \nright away.\nPreparing and filing your tax return.
