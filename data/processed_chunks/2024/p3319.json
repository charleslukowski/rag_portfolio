    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPRIL 2024  \nDEAR PROSPECTIVE LOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINIC GRANT APPLICANT: \nI am excited to announce the opening of the 2025 Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) grant application period \nat a time when the IRS is implementing key initiatives that are part of its Strategic Operating Plan to improve \ntaxpayer service and provide additional assistance to taxpayers and tax professionals.  The application period \nwill begin on April 22, 2024, and conclude on June 12, 2024.  We are eager about the prospect of increasing \ngeographic coverage, providing more service to taxpayers, and adding additional LITCs for the new grant \nyear.  The work of the LITCs has a significant impact on the taxpayers they serve.  In 2022, IRS-funded tax \nclinics helped nearly 20,000 low-income taxpayers resolve their issues with the IRS and provided consultations \nto over 15,000 more taxpayers.  They conducted over 1,400 educational activities, educating nearly 57,000 \ntaxpayers about a variety of tax topics, including their rights and responsibilities as U.S. taxpayers.  They also \nelevated 115 systemic issues to the Taxpayer Advocate Service to help ensure the fairness and integrity of the \nU.S. tax system for all taxpayers. \nFor fiscal year (FY) 2024, Congress has provided overall LITC grant funding of $28 million and has authorized \nfunding of up to $200,000 per clinic.  The President’s 2025 budget request proposes an overall LITC \ngrant funding level of $26 million and a continuation of the $200,000 per-clinic funding cap.  In light of \nthe President’s budget request and the uncertain timeline for final congressional action, the IRS will allow \napplicants to request up to $200,000 for the 2025 grant year.  The IRS will also continue the ESL Education \nPilot Program that was rolled out as part of the February 2023 supplemental funding opportunity.  If for 2025 \nCongress significantly reduces the overall LITC grant funding level or reduces the per-clinic funding cap, the \nIRS will adjust each grant recipient’s award to reflect any limitations in place at that time. \nThe IRS remains committed to achieving maximum access to representation for low-income taxpayers, \neducation for ESL taxpayers, and receiving feedback from LITCs through their advocacy on issues that impact \nthese taxpayers.  In awarding 2025 LITC grants, we will continue to work toward the following program goals: \nn Expanding coverage in areas identified as underserved; and \nn Ensuring grant recipients demonstrate they are serving geographic areas with sizable populations \neligible for and requiring LITC services. \nIRS Publication 3319 outlines the eligibility requirements for LITC matching grants and provides application \ninstructions.  This publication, including the appendices, is a good reference for LITC grant recipients and \nincludes program and administrative guidance for the grant year. \nThe IRS may award grants to qualifying organizations for up to a three-year period.  However, funding is \nprovided for one-year budget periods (January 1 - December 31), subject to the availability of annually \nappropriated funds provided by Congress.  Generally, first-time applicants will only be awarded a single-year \ngrant, unless the Notice of Funding Opportunity indicates otherwise to encourage applicants in areas with \nlimited or no LITC coverage.  For all awards, every dollar of federal funds provided by the IRS must be matched \nwith cash from non-federal sources or third-party in-kind contributions. \nAll Full Grant Applications and Non-Competing Continuation (NCC) Requests must be submitted \nelectronically by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on June 12, 2024, via www.grants.gov or \nhttps://home.grantsolutions.gov/home. The cost of preparing and submitting applications and NCC Requests \ni \nii \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \nis the responsibility of each applicant.  On April 25, 2024, and May 7, 2024, from 1:00 pm to 2:30 p.m. ET, the \nLITC Program Office will host webinars for organizations interested in submitting a full application or learning \nmore about the application process.  For more information, including a link to register for the webinar, visit \nwww.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/about-us/litc-grants. This webpage also includes a guidance document to \nhelp applicants with completing Form 13424-M, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic Application Narrative.  Existing \nLITCs submitting an NCC Request should check the LITC Toolkit for the date and time of a session on that \nspecific topic. \nQualified applicants will be notified in October 2024 of their selection for an award for the 2025 grant year.  \nAward recipients must attend the Annual LITC Grantee Conference, which will be held in December 2024.  The \nAnnual Conference provides an opportunity for new award recipients and returning LITCs to meet, network, \nshare best practices, and obtain substantive training on tax law topics relevant to low-income and ESL \ntaxpayers.  Award recipients will be notified of the conference dates as soon as they are determined.  If you \nhave questions about the LITC Program or grant application process, please contact the LITC Program Office \nat 202-317-4700 (not a toll-free call) or by email at LITCProgramOffice@irs.gov. \nWe appreciate your interest in the LITC Program, and we look forward to another successful grant \nyear as we work to help LITCs ensure the fairness and integrity of the tax system for low-income and \nESL taxpayers.  \nSincerely, \nErin M. Collins \nNational Taxpayer Advocate \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n \n \n \n \nWHAT’S NEW THIS YEAR\nBelow is a list of changes made to the program for the 2025 grant year with a cite to the relevant text in the \npublication; however, all are encouraged to read the entire publication. By accepting the Notice of Award, all \ngrant recipients are agreeing to follow the guidelines provided in this publication. \nn The areas (states and counties) of special consideration where there are no clinics or very limited \ncoverage for the 2024 grant year have been updated. (Page 2) \nn The chart of important dates has been updated, including the dates for several informational \nwebinars to help organizations navigate the application process. (Page 3) \nn Wherever the Publication (including any Forms and Instructions) references that the maximum annual \nfederal funding available is $100,000, please substitute $200,000. This increase is included in the \nPresident’s fiscal year 2025 Budget Request. If the amount differs when Congress appropriates \nfunds, the LITC Program Office will adjust all awards accordingly. (Page 3 and throughout) \nn The IRS will continue the ESL Education Pilot Program that was rolled out as part of the February \n2023 supplemental funding opportunity. (Page 12) \nn The expenditure threshold to trigger a single audit has been increased from $750,000 to $1,000,000, \nsee 2 CFR § 200.501. (Pages 17, 18, 30, 94, and 95) \nn The de minimis rate under 2 CFR § 200.414(f) of the Uniform Guidance, has changed from 10 percent \nto 15 percent. (Page 26) \nn The “Special Rule for Valuing Volunteer Services of a Qualified Representative” section was updated. \nFor the 2024 calendar year, the maximum rate at which to value services provided by a qualified \nrepresentative is $240 per hour, as prescribed in Revenue Procedure 2023-34, 2023-48 I.R.B. 1287, \nunless the representative can establish that a special factor, as described in IRC § 7430(c)(1)(B)(iii), \napplies. (Page 30) \nn The following language was added to the Qualified Business Administrator (QBA) section: A grantee \nmay outsource part of its accounting function, but a staff member must still be designated as \nthe QBA. (Page 38) \nn Due to the change in the definition of Equipment at 2 CFR 200.1, the “Recordkeeping and File \nManagement, Maintaining Records of Grant Expenditures” paragraph was updated in two places: \nThe absence of prior written approval of any element of cost will not affect the reasonableness \nor allocability of that element, unless prior written approval is specifically referenced under \n2 CFR § 200.407, such as purchases of $10,000 or more described in 2 CFR § 200.439(b)(2). Copies \nof any pre-approvals should be retained for three years from the date of purchase. Purchases of \n$10,000 or more should be noted in the clinic’s financial narrative in the year purchased. (Page 47) \nn Figure 6, LITC Income Guidelines, was updated to reflect annual updates to the federal poverty \nguidelines. (Page 52) \nn In both the Equipment and Supplies sections, the threshold amount was increased from $5,000 to \n$10,000.

Please \ndouble check your Full Grant Application or NCC Request to avoid these errors and ensure your application \nis timely processed and reviewed. \nStandard Form 424 \nn Legal name does not match the legal name in SAM.gov (Item 8a).\nn The Employer Identification Number (EIN) provided does not match the EIN in SAM.gov (Item 8b).\nn Missing attachment listing counties covered (Item 14).\nn Missing attachment listing congressional districts covered (Item 16b).\nn Requesting a multiyear grant utilizing the wrong proposed project end date (Item 17b).\nn Missing the amount(s) of matching funds to be provided (Items 18b-f).\nForm 13424-M \nn Applicants indicate a single audit was “Qualified” when it was described as “Unqualified” and \ntherefore the correct selection on the form is “Unmodified.” \nn No responses or incomplete responses are provided in the Civil Rights Review section; in particular, \nthe response to question D should address both the needs of individuals with limited English \nproficiency (LEP) and those who may need a reasonable accommodation to access services. “Not \nApplicable” is not an appropriate response because the questions apply to all organizations. \nForm 13424-J \nn Returning applicants prepare the new grant year budget working off the one submitted with the \noriginal application the prior year instead of working off the one approved during the application \namendment process. Working off the approved budget will ensure that the same errors are not \nmade again. \nn No full-time equivalent (FTE) is provided for staff on Form 13424-J, Detailed Budget Worksheet and \nNarrative Explanations, or applicants fail to state how many hours per week is considered full-time. \nThe Personnel section of the Detailed Budget Narrative Explanations should start with a statement \ndefining how many hours constitute a work week; for example, “ABC clinic computes 1.0 FTE on a \n40-hour work week (2,080 hours per year).” \nn There is no breakdown of travel and training expenses into categories such as lodging,  \ntransportation, and meals and incidentals.  \nProject Abstract (for NCC Requests only) \nn The form is missing the four primary numerical goals:  \nn New representation cases to be opened in the calendar year;\nn Consultations with low-income and ESL taxpayers;\nv \nvi \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \nn Educational activities to low-income and ESL taxpayers; and \nn Low-income and ESL taxpayers to be reached in educational activities. \nn Program Plan changes are not addressed. If there are no changes, include a statement indicating \nno changes. “Not Applicable” is not an acceptable response because the question applies to all \norganizations. \nn No responses or incomplete responses are provided in the Civil Rights Review section; in particular, \nthe response to question D should address both the needs of individuals with LEP and those who \nmay need a reasonable accommodation to access services. “Not Applicable” is not an appropriate \nresponse because the questions apply to all organizations. \nEmployer Identification Number and System for Award Management Registration \nApplicants fail to apply early enough to the IRS to receive an EIN, which is needed to complete the SAM.gov \nregistration process. SAM registration is a multi-step process that can take four to six weeks to complete. \nAttachments \nn The Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (ICRA) submitted by applicants is incomplete or expired. To \ndetermine whether the ICRA is properly applied, the LITC Program Office must know what costs were \nincluded in the Modified Direct Costs so this part of the agreement should be supplied. If the ICRA is \nexpired, the applicant should provide an explanation including whether an extension was requested \nand, if so, the date it was requested. \nn The tax-exempt determination letter (if applicable) is not provided.\nn The letter of accreditation, for academic institutions, is not provided.  \nn An incomplete copy of the single audit is submitted or the copy is missing (and it is unavailable on the  \nFederal Audit Clearinghouse website). \nn The Tax Compliance Officer substantiation documentation is not attached or is insufficient. \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS",

LITC GRANT PROGRAM PRIORITIES \nLITCs Provide Representation, Education, and Advocacy \nLITCs ensure the fairness and integrity of the tax system for taxpayers who are low-income or speak ESL by: \nn Providing pro bono representation on their behalf in tax disputes with the IRS; \nn Educating them about their rights and responsibilities as taxpayers; and \nn Identifying and advocating for issues that impact these taxpayers. \nLITCs must: \nn Provide dollar-for-dollar matching funds; and \nn Offer LITC services for free or for no more than a nominal fee. See Section I.D, Key Terms and Definitions. \nIn December 2015, Congress enacted the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TBOR)1 in Internal Revenue Code \n(IRC) § 7803(a)(3). TBOR lists rights that already existed in the IRC, putting them in simple language and \ngrouping them into ten fundamental rights. One of the ten fundamental rights taxpayers have is the right to \nretain representation,2 meaning taxpayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to \nrepresent them in their interactions with the IRS. A taxpayer who cannot afford to hire a representative has the \nright to be informed about their potential eligibility for assistance from an LITC. The LITC Program provides \nfree or low-cost access to representation for low-income taxpayers, so that achieving a correct outcome in an IRS \ndispute does not depend on a taxpayer’s ability to pay for representation. \nLITC Program Coverage \nThe IRS is committed to achieving maximum access to clinic services for low-income taxpayers under this grant \nprogram. For the 2024 grant year, however, there are several geographic areas of the country without an LITC or \nwith very limited coverage. Thus, in awarding 2025 LITC grants, we will strive to provide services to low-income \nand ESL taxpayers in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. We will prioritize the funding of \nqualiﬁed applicants to open new clinics or expand existing LITC coverage in geographic areas with no clinic or very \nlimited coverage (see list below) before adding a new clinic in a geographic area that already has a clinic or coverage. \nCoverage of an area requires more than a willingness to accept a case from an area but requires that an organization \ntake steps to promote itself as being available and willing to provide the full range of LITC services for that area. \n1 \nSee Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-113, Division Q, § 401, 129 Stat. 2242, 3117 (Dec. 18, 2015). \n2 \nSee IRC § 7803(a)(3)(I). \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nAreas of Special Consideration \nHawaii, Kansas, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia and the territory of Puerto Rico  \ncurrently do not have an LITC. In addition, two states – Florida and Montana – have only partial coverage. The \nuncovered counties in Florida are Citrus, Hamilton, Hernando, Lafayette, Madison, Nassau, St. Johns, Sumter, \nSuwannee, Taylor, Brevard, Lake, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, and Volusia. The uncovered counties in Montana  \nare Blaine, Broadwater, Carbon, Carter, Custer, Daniels, Dawson, Deer Lodge, Fallon, Fergus, Flathead, Garfield, \nGolden Valley, Granite, Jefferson, Judith Basin, Lincoln, Madison, McCone, Mineral, Missoula, Musselshell, \nPetroleum, Phillips, Pondera, Powder River, Powell, Prairie, Richland, Sanders, Sheridan, Stillwater, Sweet Grass, \nToole, Treasure, Valley, Wheatland, and Wibaux. \nFigure 1, 2024 LITC Coverage by County Map of the United States illustrating the LITC coverage \n2 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nLITC PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nI.

HISTORY OF THE LITC PROGRAM \nAs part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Congress enacted IRC § 7526 to authorize funding for \nthe LITC Program.3 The IRS created the LITC Program Ofﬁce in 1999 to award and administer the grants and \nprovide guidance, assistance, and oversight to LITCs and prospective applicants. The LITC Program Ofﬁce is part \nof the Ofﬁce of the Taxpayer Advocate (commonly referred to as the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS)), and TAS \nis led by the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA), who reports to the IRS Commissioner. \nIn 1999, the IRS awarded grants totaling nearly $1.5 million to 34 entities in 18 states and the District of \nColumbia. Since inception, the LITC Program has expanded its coverage and in 2024 there are 131 clinics funded \nwith nearly $13 million.4 The LITC Program Ofﬁce’s history of recruiting coupled with sound judgment in \nselecting federal grant recipients has fostered the growth of a nationwide network of independent organizations \nworking toward a common purpose in their local communities. The maximum statutory award amount of \n$100,000 per clinic had remained constant since the creation of the program until recently with the passage of the \n2023 appropriations legislation when it was increased to $200,000. That increase has been continued in the 2024 \nappropriations legislation and also in the President’s FY 2025 budget proposal. Despite the funding limitation, \nLITCs have consistently delivered tremendous results, new clinics join each year, and the program continues to \nexpand coverage into underserved areas of the country. \n3 \nSee IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, § 3601, 112 Stat. 685, 774 (July 22, 1998). \n4 \nThe LITC Program Office announced a supplemental funding opportunity in February 2024. At the time this publication \nwent to print, award decisions on those applications had not been made. Thus, the 131 clinics funded with nearly \n$13 million is not the final funding statistics for the LITC Program for 2024. \n3 \n4 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC.

Upon application of a qualiﬁed low-income taxpayer clinic, the Secretary is authorized \nto award a multiyear grant not to exceed 3 years. \n(4)  Criteria for awards. In determining whether to make a grant under this section, the Secretary shall \nconsider­\n(A) the numbers of taxpayers who will be served by the clinic, including the number of taxpayers in \nthe geographical area for whom English is a second language; \n(B) the existence of other low-income taxpayer clinics serving the same population; \n(C) the quality of the program offered by the low-income taxpayer clinic, including the qualiﬁcations \nof its administrators and qualiﬁed representatives, and its record, if any, in providing service to \nlow- income taxpayers; and \n(D) alternative funding sources available to the clinic, including amounts received from other grants \nand contributions, and the endowment and resources of the institution sponsoring the clinic. \n(5)  Requirement of matching funds. A low-income taxpayer clinic must provide matching funds on a dollar- \nfor-dollar basis for all grants provided under this section. Matching funds may include­\n(A) the salary (including fringe beneﬁts) of individuals performing services for the clinic; and \n(B) the cost of equipment used in the clinic. \nIndirect expenses, including general overhead of the institution sponsoring the clinic, shall not be \ncounted as matching funds. \n(6)  Provision of information regarding qualified low-income taxpayer clinics. \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury \nmay­\n(A) advise taxpayers of the availability of, and eligibility requirements for receiving, advice and \nassistance from one or more specific qualified low-income taxpayer clinics receiving funding under \nthis section, and \n(B) provide information regarding the location of, and contact information for, such clinics. \nD. KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS \n90/250 requirement was established by IRC § 7526 and provides that at least 90 percent of the taxpayers \nrepresented by a clinic have incomes that do not exceed 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. The LITC \nProgram uses the poverty guidelines published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services. See \nSection VI.C.xii, Representing Low-Income Taxpayers. \nAdvocacy as it relates to LITCs is zealously protecting the rights of low-income and ESL taxpayers. Advocacy \ncan occur on an individual or systemic basis. A substantial portion of LITC work involves assisting clients with an \nIRS controversy. Clinics advocate for the taxpayers they represent by ensuring they are paying the correct amount \nof taxes, exploring all possible options for relief, and assisting them in making a fully informed decision on how \nbest to proceed given the facts of the case and the taxpayer’s situation. Notwithstanding the unique nature of each \n6 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \ntaxpayer’s circumstances, similarly-situated taxpayers often experience similar problems with tax administration. \nAdvocacy includes, but is not limited to, identifying systemic-level issues and sharing them with TAS. TAS \ninvestigates the submissions, proposes solutions, and works with the IRS to resolve the issues, or elevates them \nto the NTA who can communicate the issues and proposed solutions to lawmakers and the IRS administration \nin her reports to Congress. Advocacy may also include responding to public requests for comments on IRS \nregulations or procedures and filing amicus briefs in cases addressing issues that directly impact low-income and \nESL taxpayers. \nAmount in controversy is the federal tax amount in dispute for each tax year for which the LITC is representing \na taxpayer. Often, the amount in controversy is the amount owed or the refund requested. In some disputes \nwith the IRS, however, the amount in controversy is the amount associated with an action taken by the IRS. \nThe amount in controversy includes the tax liability in dispute for a tax year, plus any related penalties imposed. \nWhether interest is included in the amount in controversy will depend on the nature of the controversy. The \namount in controversy is limited to the amount in dispute, which may be less than the amount speciﬁed in an \nIRS statutory notice of deﬁciency, a notice of determination, or a notice and demand. If the taxpayer is disputing \nthe amount due in more than one tax year or period, the amount in controversy is determined separately for each \nyear. See Section VI.C.xii, Representing Low-Income Taxpayers, Amount in Controversy Limit. \nCases are those matters that LITCs count and report in inventory when a taxpayer or married taxpayers retain \nthe clinic to represent them in a controversy before the IRS or a federal court. To be counted as a case, the clinic \nmust try to address the controversy, including developing a plan for representation. If the clinic is representing \na married couple, it is counted as one case. If a taxpayer stops communicating with the clinic after a plan for \nrepresentation has been developed, the clinic may still count that matter as a case. If a clinic refers the matter to a \nqualified representative, it may count the matter as a case so long as it provides ongoing monitoring and support. \nClinic refers to an LITC. See the deﬁnition of LITC below. Throughout this publication, the terms clinic, LITC, \nand grant recipient are used interchangeably. \nConsultation encompasses a discussion with or correspondence to a taxpayer designed to address the taxpayer’s \nunique circumstances and involves an analysis tailored to the taxpayer’s factual situation. A consultation does not \nresult in advocating for the taxpayer before the IRS or relevant court in a representative capacity but might include \nfact gathering and contact with the IRS that does not rise to the level of advocacy. \nControversy with the IRS is a proceeding brought by the taxpayer under the IRC or any dispute between an \nindividual and the IRS concerning the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, penalties, or interest. The \ndeﬁnition is very broad and encompasses all types of disputes arising under the IRC, except criminal tax matters. \nFor example, a controversy includes a dispute related to eligibility and receipt of Economic Impact Payments, a \nrevocation or denial of a passport under IRC § 7345, and certain civil actions arising under IRC §§ 7431 to 7435. \nThe dispute may be pending in a federal court or in any tax administration function of the IRS (e.g., Examination, \nCollection, Appeals, Accounts Management). The dispute does not have to arise under the IRC if the dispute \nis with the IRS; for example, a controversy includes civil penalties arising under Title 31 if the IRS is the other \nparty involved in the controversy. While representing a taxpayer in a controversy with the IRS, an LITC may also \nneed to represent the taxpayer in a controversy with a state or local tax agency concerning the same or related tax \nmatter. Though a controversy does not include a federal criminal tax matter, it may include a state criminal tax \nmatter. A controversy may be considered a civil matter in the federal context, but a criminal matter under state or \n7 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nLITC PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nI.

If the LITC is already representing the taxpayer in the federal civil matter, it may be appropriate for the \nLITC to expand the scope of the representation to include the state or local tax matter. \nEducational activities (also referred to as programs to inform) inform ESL or low-income individuals about \ntheir rights and responsibilities as taxpayers, and tax issues of signiﬁcance to the intended audience. The two \neducation-related numerical goals referenced on Form 13424-M, Application Narrative, VII. Program Numerical \nGoals C and D, reference those activities delivered directly to taxpayers. Educational activities may also include a \nworkshop or free training for organizations that assist low-income or ESL taxpayers. While activities delivered to \norganizations are not included in the numerical goals on Form 13424-M, these activities are reported on Form \n13424-A, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) General Information Report, and considered by the Program \nOffice. To be considered an educational activity, information about a speciﬁc tax topic or topics must be conveyed \nto the audience. LITCs should address a wide range of substantive tax issues in their educational programs and \nmaterials (e.g., ﬁling requirements, tax recordkeeping, family status issues, refundable credits, the Affordable \nCare Act, worker classiﬁcation, identity theft, information about the audit and appeals process, and collection \nalternatives). Selecting education topics relevant to community needs and offering the presentations and/or \npresentation materials in languages commonly spoken in the community allow LITCs to reach taxpayers who \notherwise might experience great difﬁculty communicating with the IRS. These programs are delivered in-person \nto a live audience, with participants registering, signing in, or being counted and allow for audience interaction \nwith the presenter. Clinics may also use virtual platforms to deliver these programs and count them as educational \nactivities for LITC reporting when there is a way for participants to be counted and for the presenter and \nparticipants to interact. \nESL taxpayers are persons for whom English is not their ﬁrst language, which also includes those who \ncommunicate using sign language. These individuals may have an additional burden understanding taxpayer rights \nand responsibilities and are a priority for LITC education and outreach efforts. This differs from the term Limited \nEnglish Proficiency (LEP), which relates to an individual’s relative ability to communicate and receive information \nin English. LEP taxpayers are a subset of ESL taxpayers but not all ESL taxpayers are LEP taxpayers. \nGrants.gov is the government website used by federal agencies to post discretionary funding opportunities. \nGrantSolutions is a web-based, comprehensive grant management system. Clinics use GrantSolutions for \nsubmitting an NCC Request, accepting a Notice of Award (NOA), submitting reports, and reporting program \nplan, stafﬁng, or budget changes. \nKey personnel are individuals necessary for the successful functioning of the LITC. Key personnel are \nresponsible for ensuring that the LITC’s day-to-day operations run smoothly, the LITC program is delivered in \naccordance with the terms and conditions of the grant, ﬁnances are properly administered, legal arguments are \nsound, and educational materials are accurate. Key personnel include the Clinic Director, Qualiﬁed Tax Expert \n(QTE), and Qualiﬁed Business Administrator (QBA). See Section VI.C.i, Standards for Operating a Low Income \nTaxpayer Clinic. \nLow-income taxpayers are individuals whose income does not exceed 250 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines. The Federal Poverty Guidelines are updated annually (usually in late January) by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS). The LITC Income Guidelines, current as of publication, can be found in \nSection VI.C.xii, Representing Low-Income Taxpayers. A sole proprietor is considered an individual and may be \n8 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \nassisted by an LITC if otherwise eligible. A business or other entity is not a low-income taxpayer eligible for LITC \nrepresentation. An individual trying to resolve a tax liability arising from personal involvement with a business can \nbe a low-income taxpayer. For example, an individual who is personally liable for taxes owed from a business (e.g., \na responsible person within the meaning of IRC § 6672) may be a low-income taxpayer, provided the individual \notherwise meets the deﬁnition. \nLITC is an organization receiving a grant pursuant to IRC § 7526. \nNominal fee is a fee that is insigniﬁcantly small or minimal. A nominal fee is a trivial payment, bearing no \nrelation to the value of the representation provided, considering all the facts and circumstances. A nominal fee \nmust be a flat fee; the fee cannot fluctuate based on an hourly rate or the type of services the LITC is providing. \nA nominal fee does not include reimbursement for actual costs incurred (e.g., photocopies, court costs, and expert \nwitness fees). \nOutreach is an activity conducted by an LITC that involves effectively publicizing and promoting the clinic’s \nservices regarding representation, education, and advocacy on behalf of low-income and ESL taxpayers. LITCs \nare encouraged to identify linguistic populations, geographic service areas, or other segments of the low-income \ntaxpayer community in which to focus outreach efforts. Outreach activities may involve direct communication \n(in-person contact or in writing) with taxpayers or may be accomplished through contacts with other \norganizations or groups that assist low-income and ESL taxpayers. Additional guidance on effective outreach can \nbe found in Section VI.C.iv, Developing a Community Outreach Plan. Outreach plans should be developed before \nthe start of the grant year during which representation and other assistance will be offered. \nPro bono panel is a group of qualiﬁed representatives (attorneys, certiﬁed public accountants (CPAs), or \nenrolled agents (EAs)) who have agreed to accept taxpayer referrals from an LITC and provide representation or \nconsultation services free of charge to low-income or ESL taxpayers. Clinics may also use volunteers to assist with \nother tasks such as education, outreach, or mentoring students. \nProgram plan is a description of the clinic’s planned operations, including a description of the services to be \noffered; how, when, and where the services will be delivered; who will provide the services; the intended recipients \nof the services; and numerical goals. The terms and conditions of an LITC grant include the applicant’s program \nplan and any subsequent changes to the plan agreed upon between the Program Ofﬁce and the clinic. \nQualified representative is: \nn An attorney; \nn A CPA; \nn An EA authorized to practice before the IRS; \nn An individual authorized to appear before the court where the controversy with the IRS will be adjudicated; or \nn An individual authorized to practice before the IRS pursuant to 31 Code of Federal Regulations \n(CFR) § 10.7(d) (e.g., a student, law graduate, tribal court advocate, or other individual for whom the IRS \nhas issued a special appearance authorization).

FEDERAL AWARD INFORMATION\nA. AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS \nAll awards are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. The IRS anticipates awarding LITC grants of up \nto $200,000 per year to qualifying organizations for the development, expansion, or continuation of an LITC. \nCongress appropriated not less than $28 million for LITC grant awards for fiscal year 2024.5 Given the timing of \nappropriations, grant funds may not be made available to grant recipients until after the grant year has begun. The \nIRS also holds some of the annually appropriated funds in reserve so well-performing clinics that were not initially \nawarded the maximum award may ask for additional funds at mid-year. Figure 2 explains how the LITC Program \nreceives its funding. \nFigure 2, How the LITC Program Receives Its Funding \nStep One.\n Office o\nf Managemen\nt and Budg\net coordinates with feder\nal agencies to formulate\n the President’s Bud\nget, which covers all fede\nral agencies, including t\nhe IRS, and reflects the Pre\nsident’s priorities and vi\nsion for the country. Feder\nal law requires that the\n President submit a budget\n proposal to Congress b\netween the first Mo\nnday in January and the fir\nst Monday in February, whi\nch serves as a starting po\nint for negotiations in Con\ngress. \n\nStep Two. Cong\nressional app\nropriations committee conside\nr the President’s Budget\n as they prepare appropriat\nions legislation for th\ne upcoming fiscal year, which\n begins on October 1. \n\nStep \nThree. The \nappropriations comm\nittees submit legi\nslative proposals which are \nbrought to the floor for cons\nideration by the House of R\nepresentatives and the Sena\nte. Once the House and \nthe Senate consider the \nproposals and reconcile them\n, Congress passes a unif\nied omnibus budget and \nsends the legislation to t\nhe President to be sign\ned into law. \n\nSt\nep Four. The President s\nigns the appropriations bill i\nnto law, making funds avai\nlable to executive a\ngencies, including the IRS. \n\nB. ‰\nAWARD PERFORMANCE PERIOD \nThe LITC Program may award grants for up to a three-year period. However, funding is provided for one-year \nperiods (January 1–December 31), subject to the availability of annually appropriated funds. Generally, first-time \napplicants will only be awarded a single-year grant. Multiyear grants will only be awarded to applicants that have \nsuccessfully completed at least one year under the terms and conditions of the LITC grant unless the Notice of \n5  \nFurther Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, Div. B (March 23, 2024). Although funds are \nappropriated for a fiscal year, the Program Office awards grants on an annual basis. \n10 \n11 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

Determination of the grant period is at the discretion of the LITC \nProgram Ofﬁce. Thus, the Program Ofﬁce may elect to award a single-year grant to applicants that requested a \nmultiyear grant. \nMultiyear grant recipients will be reviewed annually for satisfactory performance and progress in meeting goals \nand objectives and compliance with grant terms and conditions. The funding level for subsequent years will be \nreviewed annually and may be increased or decreased at the discretion of the LITC Program Ofﬁce, based on \nperformance, compliance with grant terms and conditions, and the availability of annually appropriated funds. \nFunds awarded must be used for the program speciﬁcally authorized in the NOA. \nC. SUBAWARDS ARE GENERALLY PROHIBITED \nGenerally, a clinic may not make a subaward of LITC grant funds to another organization or individual. A \nsubaward is a payment to another organization or contractor to deliver a key component of the program such as \ncontroversy representation or ESL education. Subawards may be considered if the award of a subgrant is likely to \nassist a grant recipient with expanding coverage to an underserved or uncovered area. Use of a subaward must be \nproposed in the application and approved in writing by the Director of the LITC Program. A subaward differs \nfrom payments made to a vendor or provider for providing goods and services to the clinic, which is permissible. \nFor example, unless authorized, an LITC may not pay another organization to prepare and conduct its ESL \neducational activities; however, the clinic could pay a ﬁrm to translate its educational materials into another \nlanguage or hire an interpreter to assist with delivery of education. If a sponsoring organization is located in a \ndifferent geographic area from the service area and has capacity to provide services remotely such as representation \nand advocacy services but needs a local presence to facilitate client contact and provide in-person education and \noutreach, the subaward of funds to a local organization to deliver some of these services may be appropriate where \nthe proposed area to be covered is either underserved or uncovered. \nNOTE: In accordance with 2 CFR § 25.300(a), a clinic may not make a subaward unless the subrecipient \nhas obtained and provided to the clinic a unique entity identifier (the identifier assigned by SAM.gov to \nuniquely identify business entities). Grant recipients who make subawards must monitor and manage the \nsubaward recipient per the requirements in 2 CFR § 200.332 and may have other administrative and reporting \nresponsibilities. Organizations that provide subawards assume the responsibilities of the federal grantor regarding \nthe subaward recipient. \nD. LITC GRANTS ARE NOT COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS \nFunds awarded under IRC § 7526 create grant agreements rather than cooperative agreements between the \nrecipient and the IRS. A cooperative agreement provides for substantial involvement between the federal awarding \nagency and the grant recipient in carrying out the activity contemplated by the federal award. While the LITC \nProgram Ofﬁce has numerous responsibilities in administering the grant and providing oversight and assistance \nto clinics, that involvement does not result in the formation of a cooperative agreement. See the deﬁnitions of \n“cooperative agreement” and “grant agreement” in 2 CFR § 200.1, Definitions, for additional details. \n12 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nIII. AWARD ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS \nApplicants that fail to satisfy the eligibility screening criteria described below will be notiﬁed and, in some \ncircumstances, may be provided an opportunity to correct the problem. Those provided an opportunity must \ncorrect the problem in a timely manner or be eliminated from consideration. Applications that pass the eligibility \nscreening will then undergo a technical evaluation. See Section V, Application Review. \nA. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS \nIRC § 7526 broadly defines the concept of a clinic to include: \n1) A clinical program at an accredited law, business, or accounting school whose students represent low-income \ntaxpayers in controversies with the IRS under the supervision of a qualified representative (and when necessary, \nrefer to qualified volunteers to provide representation when the students cannot do so); \n2) An organization whose employees and volunteers represent low-income taxpayers in controversies with the \nIRS; \n3) An organization exempt from tax under IRC § 501(a) whose employees and volunteers represent low-income \ntaxpayers in controversies with the IRS or refer low-income taxpayers to qualified representatives to provide \nrepresentation; \n4) An organization described in examples 1), 2), or 3) that also operates a program to inform ESL taxpayers \nabout their taxpayer rights and responsibilities under the IRC; and \n5) An organization that operates a program to inform ESL taxpayers about their taxpayer rights and  \nresponsibilities under the IRC.  \nWhile IRC § 7526 provides that an organization is eligible to receive a matching grant if it either represents low-\nincome taxpayers in controversies with the IRS or operates a program to inform ESL taxpayers about their rights \nand responsibility under the IRC, the mission of the LITC Program is best served by requiring all organizations \ninterested in receiving a grant under IRC § 7526 to generally provide both services. Organizations that develop \nthe capacity to provide both controversy and education services are generally more robust and able to provide \nthe most effective service to eligible taxpayers. For example, organizations sometimes assist taxpayers initially \nthrough outreach and education, and later through representation in a controversy; in these cases, the ability of an \norganization to provide both services not only ensures seamless assistance for taxpayers, but also provides extensive \nprotection of taxpayer rights. Thus, the Program Office will only award funds to an organization that is operating \na program to inform ESL individuals in addition to providing representation to low-income taxpayers. The only \nexception is the new ESL Education Pilot Program started in 2023 and continuing for 2025, under which a grant \nmay be awarded to an organization to operate a program to inform ESL taxpayers about their taxpayer rights \nand responsibilities under the IRC without the requirement to also provide tax controversy representation to \nlow-income taxpayers. \n13 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS EQUAL TO AWARD \nIRC § 7526(c)(5) requires clinics to provide matching funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis for all federal funds \nawarded by the IRS. The matching funds requirement ensures that each LITC grant represents a ﬁnancial \npartnership between the clinic and the federal government for the beneﬁt of low-income and ESL taxpayers. The \ncommitment of matching funds by the clinic leverages the federal funding investment so an LITC can assist more \ntaxpayers in need. Many programs provide matching funds in cash or third-party in-kind contributions (e.g., \ntime worked by volunteers, donated software or office space) that far exceed the minimum required. Only funds \nused in direct support of the LITC Program qualify as matching funds. See Section IV.E.iii, Meeting the Matching \nFunds Requirement. \nC.  OTHER  ELIGIBILITY  REQUIREMENTS  \ni. \nUsing Grant Funds to Support Other Activities is Prohibited \nAn organization awarded an LITC grant may provide qualifying LITC services within a broader spectrum of \nactivity. For example, a clinic may provide representation in nontax matters (e.g., landlord/tenant disputes, \nfamily law cases) and representation in tax matters, provided LITC grant funds are used only to support the \nrepresentation of eligible taxpayers in a controversy with the IRS and/or a state or local tax agency concerning the \nsame or related tax matter. LITC grant funds may also be used for properly allocated portions of indirect costs of \nthe organization that support LITC grant activities. \nii. Charging More Than a Nominal Fee for Services Is Prohibited \nAn LITC may not charge more than a nominal fee for its services. If a clinic charges a nominal fee, it must charge \nthat same fee to all taxpayers, regardless of the services being sought. The goal of the LITC Program is to enhance \naccess to representation, education, and advocacy services for low-income taxpayers. If a clinic charges an amount \nthat is not nominal and it results in fewer taxpayers assisted, the goal of the program is not being achieved. A clinic \nmay not charge a separate or additional fee (even if it is nominal) to prepare a tax return or a claim for refund. \nNOTE: Reimbursement of actual costs incurred (e.g., photocopying, court costs, and expert witness fees) is not \nconsidered a fee and is, therefore, permitted. \niii. Compliance With Federal Tax and Nontax Requirements \nFederal Tax Debts \nThe IRS will not award an LITC grant to an applicant noncompliant with a federal tax return ﬁling or payment \nobligation. Consequently, an applicant must be in full compliance with its federal tax responsibilities when \napplying for an LITC grant and throughout the grant year. Standard Form 424, Application for Federal \nAssistance, in Appendix A, requires the applicant to state whether it is delinquent on any federal debt and if so, to \nprovide an explanation. The LITC Program Ofﬁce also conducts reviews to conﬁrm applicants’ compliance with \nfederal tax responsibilities and other terms and conditions of the grant. See Section III.C.i, Using Grant Funds to \nSupport Other Activities is Prohibited. \n14 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nAn outstanding federal tax debt is any unpaid federal tax liability (including penalties and interest) that has \nbeen assessed, is not disputed, and for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or \nhave lapsed. An applicant or grant recipient will not be treated as noncompliant for purposes of IRC § 7526 \n(and therefore still eligible for funding) if the applicant or grant recipient is in a dispute with the IRS regarding \na federal tax liability or has entered into and remains current with an installment agreement or other payment \narrangement with the federal government to satisfy any federal tax liabilities. If you are working with someone at \nthe IRS to resolve an outstanding federal tax issue, please provide their name, office in which they work, and their \nphone number when you complete Standard Form 424, question #20. \nIRC § 6103 prohibits the LITC Program Ofﬁce from disclosing a federal tax compliance issue to anyone who \nis not authorized to receive the taxpayer’s tax information. Therefore, to facilitate the resolution of any potential \nfederal tax compliance issues, Form 13424, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Application Information, \nrequires applicants to provide contact information for the Tax Compliance Ofﬁcer (TCO), the individual \nresponsible for handling the organization’s federal tax matters. Some applicants are part of a larger organization \n(e.g., an academic institution that operates a clinic), in which case the LITC Program Ofﬁce must be able to verify \nthat the sponsoring organization does not have a federal tax compliance issue before awarding grant funds. The \nTCO must be the person who is the individual responsible for handling the sponsoring organization’s federal tax \nmatters. Applicants must also provide documentation (e.g., articles of incorporation or a Form 2848, Power of \nAttorney and Declaration of Representative, signed by the appropriate official) that shows how the individual on \nForm 13424 is properly authorized to receive tax information to prevent the IRS from making an unauthorized \ndisclosure. When providing articles of incorporation, ensure it is the most recent version. When providing Form \n2848, be sure of the following: \nn All required fields are completed; \nn In section 3, the type(s) of tax are listed (e.g., 940, 941, 1120, 1065, 990); \nn In section 3, both current and past tax years are listed (e.g., 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020); \nn In section 7, the form is signed by an officer of the corporation authorized under the articles of  \nincorporation to designate an individual to receive federal tax information for the entity; and  \nn In Part II, the form is signed by the person being authorized to receive the tax information. \nComplying with federal tax obligations is a requirement to receive an LITC grant, so it is imperative that the \ndesignated individual be knowledgeable and prepared to promptly address any federal tax issues of the applicant \nor the sponsoring organization. Failure to provide an appropriate contact could delay application processing if \nthe LITC Program Ofﬁce identiﬁes a federal tax compliance issue of the applicant or its sponsoring organization \nand needs to discuss the issue further. In addition, if the LITC Program Ofﬁce cannot speak with the appropriate \ncontact to ascertain the status of the organization’s efforts to address a federal tax compliance issue, no grant funds \nwill be awarded to the applicant. Similarly, even after grant funds have been awarded, the LITC Program Ofﬁce \nperforms tax compliance checks throughout the grant year. Without an appropriate contact with whom the LITC \nProgram Ofﬁce can discuss a tax compliance issue, if a tax compliance issue arises during the grant year, the LITC \nProgram Ofﬁce may need to restrict the clinic’s access to grant funds. \n15 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

An outstanding federal nontax debt is an unpaid federal liability (other than a federal tax \nobligation) that has been assessed, is not disputed, and for which all administrative and judicial remedies have \nbeen exhausted or have lapsed. An applicant or grant recipient will not be treated as noncompliant for purposes \nof IRC § 7526 (and therefore still eligible for funding) if the applicant or grant recipient is in a dispute with the \nfederal government regarding a federal nontax liability or has entered into and remains current with an installment \nagreement or other payment arrangement with the federal government to satisfy any outstanding federal nontax \nobligations. The LITC Program Ofﬁce utilizes SAM to help determine whether an applicant or grant recipient is \neligible to receive payments. See Section III.C.i, Using Grant Funds to Support Other Activities is Prohibited. \niv. Debarment and Suspension\nWhen applying for a grant, applicants must make certain certiﬁcations and provide certain assurances. One of \nthose certiﬁcations is the Certiﬁcation Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters- \nPrimary Covered Transactions. Applying the “common rule” on non-procurement, debarment, and suspension6 \nadopted by the Department of the Treasury at 31 CFR Part 19, Subpart C, an applicant must certify that its \norganization and the clinic’s proposed key personnel are not presently debarred or suspended from covered \ntransactions by any federal agency. In addition, an applicant must indicate that within the three-year period before \napplying for a grant, its organization and the clinic’s proposed key personnel have not been convicted of or had \na civil judgment rendered against them for fraud, theft, or certain other offenses, and have not had one or more \npublic transactions terminated for cause or default. An applicant must also indicate that its organization and the \nclinic’s proposed key personnel are not presently criminally or civilly charged with certain offenses. \nApplicants may check the status of the organization and the clinic’s proposed key personnel before applying for a \ngrant by searching on www.SAM.gov. If an applicant identiﬁes incorrect information about the organization or \nthe clinic’s proposed key personnel, the applicant should contact the agency that reported the information. The \nLITC Program Ofﬁce utilizes SAM to determine eligibility of grant applicants and prevent improper payments. \n6 \nThe “common rule” means the procedures used by federal agencies to suspend, debar, or exclude individuals or entities from \nparticipation in nonprocurement transactions under Executive Order 12549.

APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION PROCESS\nIII\nII\nV\nVI\nVII\nI\nV\nVI\nVII\nVIII\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nz For an applicant that does not have audited ﬁnancial statements, an unaudited statement for its \nmost recent ﬁscal year and a statement as to why an audited ﬁnancial statement is not available; \nn Documentation (e.g., articles of incorporation or an IRS Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration \nof Representative) indicating that the designated TCO on Form 13424 is properly authorized to receive tax \ninformation; and \nn Indirect cost rate agreement, if applicable. \nvi. Withdrawing Applications After Submission \nLITC grant applications may be withdrawn during the application process or prior to when grant money is \nawarded by notifying the LITC Program Ofﬁce by fax or email. See Section VII.F, Contacting the LITC Program \nOffice. Application withdrawals cannot be completed through Grants.gov or GrantSolutions. \nC. SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT \nAND UNIQUE ENTITY IDENTIFIERS \nAn organization must be registered with SAM to submit a grant application, and registration requires the \norganization to provide an EIN from the IRS. The SAM registration and renewal process have multiple steps \nand can take four to six weeks to complete. Applicants are advised to register for an EIN and complete the SAM \nregistration (or renewal) process well in advance of the application submission deadline. See Avoiding Application \nCommon Errors and Missteps When Applying. \ni. \nSystem for Award Management \nSAM is a web-enabled government-wide application that collects, validates, stores, and disseminates business \ninformation about the federal government’s trading partners supporting the contract award, grant, and electronic \npayment processes. SAM registration is necessary to submit a grant application and must be maintained with \ncurrent information while an application for funding is pending and during the performance period of any federal \naward. More information about these processes is available on the SAM website at www.SAM.gov. \nUnless exempted from this requirement under 2 CFR § 25.110, a clinic must maintain current information in \nSAM. This includes information on the clinic’s immediate and highest level owner and subsidiaries and the clinic’s \npredecessors awarded a federal contract or federal financial assistance within the last three years, if applicable, \nuntil the clinic submits the final financial report required under this federal award or receives the final payment, \nwhichever is later. This requires that the clinic review and update the information at least annually after the initial \nregistration and more frequently if required by changes in the clinic’s information or another federal award term. \nSee Appendix A to 2 CFR Part 25. Individuals registering a new entity and those renewing a registration must \nprovide an original, signed notarized letter stating that the individual is the authorized Entity Administrator \nbefore the registration will be activated or renewed. \nIf already registered in SAM, renewal of the registration is required annually. Check when your registration will \nexpire and update. You may update as often as you want, but you must update at least once per year. The process \ncan take several weeks to complete. \n20 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ni. \nDue Date for LITC Full Grant Applications and Non-Competing \nContinuation Requests \nii. Employer Identification Number \nAn Employer Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the IRS to business entities \noperating in the U.S. or U.S. territories for identiﬁcation and is required to submit an LITC grant application. \nApplicants without an EIN should submit a Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identiﬁcation Number, to the \nIRS. It can take four weeks for the IRS to assign a number if applying by mail. The fastest way to obtain an EIN is \nonline at www.irs.gov/ein. There are options to apply by fax or by mail, but applicants are strongly encouraged to \nuse online submission. For more information, search “How to Apply for an EIN” on www.irs.gov. \niii. Unique Entity Identifier \nOrganizations must provide a Unique Entity Identiﬁer (UEI) with the grant application. As of April 4, 2022, the \nUEI replaced the DUNS number, a nine-digit unique entity identiﬁer that was provided by Dun & Bradstreet, \nInc. The UEI is assigned and managed through SAM. Applicants will no longer have to go to a third-party website \nto obtain an identifier. This change allows the government to streamline the entity identification and validation \nprocess and lessens administrative burden for entities that want to do business with the federal government. For \nmore information about the transition from DUNS to UEI, visit the GSA webpage at www.gsa.gov/about-us/ \norganization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/integrated-award-environment-iae/ \niae-systems-information-kit/unique-entity-identifier-update. \niv. Organization Name Change Requests \nAll sponsoring organization name changes are processed through SAM. More information is available on the SAM \nwebsite at www.SAM.gov. As a reminder, the LITC Program Office must be kept informed of any changes to the \nsponsoring organization. See Section VI.E.i, Changes in Entity of Sponsoring Organization. \nD. SUBMISSION DUE DATES AND TIMES \nTo be considered for 2025 LITC grant funding, grant applications must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. ET on \nJune 12, 2024. The time and date of the email conﬁrmation from Grants.gov acknowledging application \nsubmission serves as evidence that the Full Grant Application was timely submitted and should be retained by \nthe applicant. Similarly, the time and date of the email conﬁrmation from GrantSolutions acknowledging the \nsubmission of the NCC Request serves as evidence that the NCC Request was timely submitted and should be \nretained by the applicant. \nBEST PRACTICE \nApplicants are encouraged to download and maintain a copy of the completed application \npacket. \n21 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS AND FUNDING RESTRICTIONS \ni. \nSpending LITC Grant Funds and Matching Funds \nGrant funds and matching funds must be used for expenses in accordance with the cost principles guidance in \n2 CFR Parts 200 and 1000. Generally, for an expense to be allowable, the expense must: \nn Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the federal award and be allocable thereto under the \napplicable cost principles. See 2 CFR § 200.403(a); \nn Conform to any limitations or exclusions in the cost principles or in the federal award as to types or amount \nof cost items. See 2 CFR § 200.403(b); \nn Follow policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally-ﬁnanced and other activities of the \ngrant recipient. See 2 CFR § 200.403(c); \nn Be accorded consistent treatment by the grant recipient. A cost may not be assigned to a federal award as \na direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the \nfederal award as an indirect cost. See 2 CFR § 200.403(d); \nn Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except for state \nand local governments and Indian tribes only, as otherwise provided for in the cost principles. See \n2 CFR § 200.403(e); \nn Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost-sharing or matching requirements of any other federally-\nﬁnanced program in either the current or a prior period. See 2 CFR § 200.403(f); \nn Be adequately documented. See 2 CFR § 200.403(g); and \nn Be incurred during the approved budget period. See 2 CFR § 200.403(h). \nNOTE: In general, grant funds cannot be carried forward from one year to the next unless the LITC Program \nOffice approves such carryover. In appropriate circumstances, however, the LITC Program Office may use \ndiscretion to waive prior written approvals to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods \npursuant to 2 CFR § 200.308(g)(3). \nClinics should refer to the Uniform Guidance for detailed rules regarding allowable and unallowable expenses. \nGenerally, the same rules that apply to expenditures made using federal grant funds apply to expenditures made \nusing matching funds. However, IRC § 7526(c)(5) speciﬁcally prohibits indirect expenses, including general \n22 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \noverhead of the institution sponsoring the clinic, from being counted as matching funds. The Department of \nthe Treasury, of which the IRS is a part, adopted the provisions in 2 CFR Part 200,7 unless specific exceptions \nwere set forth in 2 CFR § 1000.306, which addresses the valuation rate applicable to controversy representation \nvolunteer hours used as match, and 2 CFR § 1000.337, which clarifies that the right to access of records under \n2 CFR § 200.337 does not extend to client information held by authorized LITC practitioners. \nBEST PRACTICE \nKnowledge and understanding of the Uniform Guidance is crucial to properly manage LITC \ngrant funds. Several independent vendors provide training on the Uniform Guidance, and it is \nhighly recommended for QBAs new to managing federal grant funds to enroll in the training. \nGrant funds may be used to attend such training if the expense conforms to 2 CFR § 200.403. \nStart-Up Expenses May Be Paid Using LITC Grant Funds \nLITC grant funds may be used on start-up activities, and an applicant may be selected to receive an LITC grant \naward for the full grant year even if it anticipates that it cannot begin operations at the start of the performance \nperiod. All grant recipients must satisfy the statutory matching funds requirement during the period covered \nby the grant and must meet all reporting requirements, regardless of when operations begin. Reports should \nprovide information on the status of the start-up activities. In addition, LITC grants to these applicants will \nbe conditioned on the performance of required grant activities as detailed in Section I.A, LITC Grant Program \nPriorities, during the immediately succeeding grant year; however, grant funds for the immediately succeeding \ngrant year are not guaranteed to be awarded if adequate progress is not made and established milestones not \ntimely reached. \nExamples of Allowable Expenses \nFigure 3 lists examples of common expenditures for an LITC. The left-hand column lists items that are an \nallowable use of federal grant funds or matching funds, and the right-hand column lists items that are not an \nallowable use of federal grant funds or matching funds. This is not an all-inclusive list. If clinics have questions \nabout whether an expense is allowable, they should consult the Uniform Guidance. If they still have questions, \nthey should contact their assigned Advocacy Analyst for guidance before incurring the expense. \n7 \nSee 2 CFR Part 1000. \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

Direct vs. Indirect Expenses \nDirect expenses are the necessary and reasonable expenses that support LITC activities and the functions of \nthe organization. The expenses should be allocated and charged as a direct cost of award funds if it is practical \nto separate the portion of the expense allocable to LITC activities. The determination of whether it is practical \nor reasonable to allocate expenses directly in proportion to use depends on several factors, including the size of \nthe organization operating the LITC, the size and number of other functions the organization operates, and the \namount of the expense. \nIndirect expenses are often commonly referred to as Facilities and Administration (F&A) costs. The Uniform  \nGuidance deﬁnes indirect costs as:  \n[T]hose costs incurred for a common or joint purpose beneﬁtting more than one cost objective, and \nnot readily assignable to the cost objectives speciﬁcally beneﬁtted, without effort disproportionate to the \nresults achieved. 2 CFR § 200.1, Definitions. \nFor example, an organization’s $5,000 expense supports LITC activities and two other programs the organization \noperates. Suppose the organization can spend an additional $100 in administrative costs to accurately allocate \nthe $5,000 among the three programs in proportion to the beneﬁt each receives. In that case, the allocation is \nreasonable, and the organization should perform the allocation and charge the portion of the $5,000 that is \nallocable to LITC activities as a direct cost. \n24 \n25 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION PROCESS\nIII\nII\nV\nVI\nVII\nI\nV\nVI\nVII\nVIII\n \n \nNow suppose the organization’s $5,000 expense supports LITC activities and two other programs the organization \noperates, but to properly allocate the $5,000 among the three programs in proportion to the beneﬁt each \nreceives, it would cost the organization an additional $2,000 in administrative costs. In that case, direct allocation \nof the cost is not cost-effective, and the organization can account for the $5,000 expense as an indirect cost. \nThe organization then apportions the total indirect costs (i.e., the indirect cost pool) to each of the beneﬁting \nprograms using a method that is consistent, reasonable, auditable, and in accordance with generally accepted \nbusiness practices. \nThe Uniform Guidance in 2 CFR § 200.414(b) recognizes that because of the diverse characteristics and \naccounting practices of nonproﬁt organizations, it is not possible to specify the types of costs which may be \nclassiﬁed as indirect expenses in all situations. The purpose of the federal award is the determining factor in \ndistinguishing direct from indirect costs, rather than the nature of the goods and services expensed. \nTypical indirect expenses may include: \nn Salaries and wages of administrative and support staff; \nn Related employee beneﬁts; \nn Facility occupancy costs (e.g., utilities, security, maintenance); \nn Ofﬁce supplies; and \nn Legal and auditing charges. \nOnce the organization has classiﬁed expenses as either direct or indirect, the organization must determine how \nto allocate the indirect costs among the programs they beneﬁt, so LITC funds do not subsidize the indirect \ncosts of other programs or functions of the organization. To calculate the amount of federal funds allocable to \nindirect costs, the organization may use a negotiated ICRA approved by the organization’s cognizant agency. If the \norganization does not have a current negotiated (including provisional) rate, it may elect to charge a de minimis \nrate of 15 percent. \nIndirect costs may not be used to satisfy matching funds obligations. See IRC § 7526(c)(5). \nNegotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreements and Cognizant Agencies \nObtaining an ICRA is a complex process that requires preparing and submitting an indirect cost rate proposal \n(including supporting schedules and documentation) and may take several months or even years to establish a \nﬁnal rate. A cognizant agency for indirect costs means the federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, \nand approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals developed under 2 CFR Part 200 on behalf of all \nfederal agencies. See 2 CFR § 200.1. For Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), cost negotiation cognizance is \nassigned to HHS or the Department of Defense (DoD) Ofﬁce of Naval Research, depending on which of the two \nagencies provides more funds to the educational institution for the most recent three years.

    "text": "Appendix III of the Uniform Guidance, Indirect (F&A) Costs Identiﬁcation and Assignment, and Rate \nDetermination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), paragraph C,11. \n26 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \nFor nonproﬁt organizations, the federal agency that awards the largest dollar value to the organization will be \ndesignated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The federal agency will negotiate and approve the indirect \ncost rates (unless different arrangements are agreed to by the federal agencies concerned) and where necessary, \nnegotiate and approve other rates such as fringe beneﬁt and computer charge-out rates. See 2 CFR Part 200, \nAppendix IV, Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit \nOrganizations, paragraph C,2,A. If an applicant has no other sources of federal funding and has questions about \nobtaining an ICRA, please contact the LITC Program Office to discuss possible options. \nOrganizations that apply an ICRA to determine the portion of indirect costs allocable to a federal award must \ncarefully separate direct costs from costs classiﬁed as indirect in the ICRA, and the ICRA must set forth cost items \nincluded in the rate. Indirect costs are then calculated by applying the negotiated rate against the direct cost base. \nCosts accounted for as indirect costs in the ICRA may not be expensed as direct costs (i.e., double-dipping). For \nexample, if a clinic is part of a larger organization with an ICRA and the rental cost of the facility in which the \nclinic operates is included in the negotiated rate, the clinic may not include the facilities cost as a direct expense. \nThe contractual expense category can be found on Form 13424-L, Statement of Grant Expenditures. \nProvisional Cost Rate Agreement \nIf a grant recipient is operating under a provisional ICRA at the commencement of the budget period (also \nreferred to as funding period), which ordinarily commences January 1 and concludes December 31 of the same \ncalendar year, the provisional rate will be used for billing and reporting purposes for that period. The rate when \nﬁnalized will be applied to future budget periods during which the grant recipient receives funding, if any. \nDe Minimis Indirect Cost Rate \nUnder 2 CFR § 200.414(f) of the Uniform Guidance, a de minimis rate of 15 percent of Modified Total Direct \nCosts (MTDC) is available for organizations that never had a negotiated ICRA and those that had a negotiated rate \nthat has expired. No documentation is required to justify the 15 percent de minimis indirect cost rate. However, if \nthe clinic elects to use the de minimis rate to charge indirect costs, it must charge costs consistently across federal \ngrants and may not double charge or inconsistently charge as both. \nModified Total Direct Cost \nMTDC includes all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe beneﬁts, materials and supplies, services, and travel. \nMTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, \nand participant support costs. Other items may only be excluded when necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the \ndistribution of indirect costs, and with the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. See 2 CFR § 200.1. \nIf a grant recipient charges indirect costs based on an approved ICRA, a copy of the \nagreement must be submitted along with application Form 13424-J, Detailed Budget \nWorksheet and Narrative Explanations.

Meeting the Matching Funds Requirement \nGrant recipients must provide matching funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis for all federal LITC grant funds \nreceived. See IRC § 7526(c)(5). In general, the Uniform Guidance provides that all contributions, including cash \nand third-party in-kind, can be accepted as matching funds when such contributions are: \nn Veriﬁable from the grant recipient’s records. See 2 CFR § 200.306(b)(1); \nn Not used as a match or contribution for any other federal award. See 2 CFR § 200.306(b)(2); \nn Necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of LITC Program objectives. See 2 CFR § 200.306(b)(3); \nn Allowable under the applicable cost principles. See 2 CFR § 200.306(b)(4); \nn Not paid by the federal government under another award, except when authorized by federal statute. See \n2 CFR § 200.306(b)(5); \nn Provided for in the grant recipient’s approved budget. See 2 CFR § 200.306(b)(6); and \nn In conformity with other applicable provisions of the Uniform Guidance. See 2 CFR § 200.306(b)(7). \nQualiﬁed matching funds can be derived from multiple sources and in various forms, such as cash, services \nprovided by volunteers, property, and income from program activities. Third party in-kind contributions, defined \nin 2 CFR § 200.1, means the value of non-cash contributions (i.e., property or services) that (a) benefit a federally \nassisted project or program; and (b) are contributed by non-federal third parties, without charge, to a non-\nfederal entity under a federal award. Grants may be awarded based on good faith estimates of matching funds, \nincluding veriﬁable pledge commitments or other likely sources of funding. However, grant recipients are advised \nto monitor the sources and uses of matching funds throughout the grant year to ensure that sufﬁcient matching \nfunds are available to meet the dollar-for-dollar match requirement in IRC § 7526(c)(5). Failure to document the \nsources and amounts of all matching funds may result in the LITC Program Ofﬁce requiring the grant recipient \nto repay federal funds (plus any applicable interest) received in excess of the documented match. Failure to repay \nthe funds within 90 days after the demand results in a debt to the federal government that can be collected by the \nIRS in accordance with 2 CFR § 200.346. \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nQualified matching funds include  \n(but are not limited to): \n \n \n \n \nIneligible matching funds include  \n(but are not limited to): \nLegal Services Corporation funds. \nExpenses incurred for the purchase, construction, \n \nrepair, or rehabilitation of any building or any portion \nthereof. \n \nSalaries, including fringe benefits, of clinic staff. \nServices provided by students that are not furnished \non a volunteer basis, such as in exchange for \nacademic credit. \nEquipment and supplies used in the clinic. \nFederal work-study funds. \nOther costs necessary to the operation of the \nprogram. \n \nFunds from other federal grants unless specifically \nauthorized by statute. See 2 CFR § 200.306(b)(5). \nThe value of volunteer services furnished by \n \nprofessional and technical personnel, consultants, \nand other skilled and unskilled labor. \nIndirect costs, including general overhead of the \n \ninstitution sponsoring the LITC. \nThe fair market value of donated equipment and \nsupplies. \nThe fair rental value of donated space. \n \n \n \nProgram Income (e.g., nominal fees charged or \nawards of attorney’s fees). See 2 CFR §§ 200.1 and \n200.307 for a definition and discussion of program \nincome, respectively. \n \n \nFigure 4, Qualified and Ineligible Matching Funds \nIf an individual on the LITC staff receives an award or fellowship from a non-federal source (e.g., \nthe ABA Section of Taxation Public Service Fellowship), the amount of the award may be included \nas matching funds to the extent the award proceeds are used to support LITC activities. \nValuing Contributions of Goods and Services to Meet the Matching Funds Requirement \nContributions of goods and services provided to a grant recipient must be valued in accordance with applicable \ncost principles. These principles generally limit values to: \nn The amount a prudent person would pay for the goods or services in an arm’s length transaction under the \ncircumstances prevailing at the time the cost was incurred. See 2 CFR § 200.404(b); or \nn Fair market value. See 2 CFR § 200.404(c). \nNon-cash contributions (e.g., goods, space, or volunteer services donated to the LITC) from parties other than the \ngrant recipient or the federal government (i.e., third-party in-kind contributions) must be valued in accordance \nwith the principles stated in 2 CFR § 200.306 (except for contributions of certain volunteer services by a qualiﬁed \nrepresentative governed by 2 CFR § 1000.306). \n28 \n29 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION PROCESS\nIII\nII\nV\nVI\nVII\nI\nV\nVI\nVII\nVIII\n \nDetermining the Value of Volunteer Services \nThe rates used to value volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the organization and \nmay include a reasonable amount for fringe beneﬁts. If no one else on staff performs similar work that could provide \na basis for comparative valuation, the organization must use a rate consistent with the labor market rate for similar \nwork. One source of wage rates by geographic area can be found on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website at \nhttps://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm. However, BLS data represents a wage rate only, and when used to determine a \nvolunteer services valuation rate, it can be adjusted upward by adding a reasonable fringe beneﬁts amount. \nIf a third-party employer (e.g., a local law ﬁrm’s pro bono campaign) provides one of its employees to work for the \napplicant at no cost, those services are valued at the employee’s regular rate of pay, plus reasonable fringe beneﬁts, \nprovided the services are in the same skillset for which the employee is normally paid. If a local law ﬁrm offered \nten hours of volunteer service from an associate attorney in its tax division to an LITC, the LITC could value \nthose ten hours at the attorney’s regular rate of pay at the law ﬁrm, plus reasonable fringe beneﬁts, provided the \nattorney performs ten hours of substantive legal work. See 2 CFR § 200.306(f). \nValuation Depends on the Type of Services \nGrant recipients should also be mindful that a volunteer may meet the deﬁnition of a qualiﬁed representative yet \nmay be providing services to the clinic in a non-representative capacity. In the previous example, if the attorney \nspent ten hours repainting the lobby of the LITC over a weekend instead of performing legal work, the LITC \ncould still count the volunteer’s time as matching funds; however, it would need to value the attorney’s time at the \nrate for hiring a painter in the local labor market, plus reasonable fringe beneﬁts. \nServices Donated by Employees May Not Be Used as Matching Contributions \nAn employee of the grant recipient may not be treated as a volunteer for purposes of valuing in-kind services. \nFor example, suppose an LITC pays an employee an hourly wage to work at the LITC three days a week, and \nthe employee spends an additional two days each week volunteering at the LITC. In the example, the LITC may \ncharge the employee’s wages as an expenditure of federal or matching funds, but it cannot apply the value of the \ntwo days spent volunteering as a contribution to help meet the matching funds requirement. \nSpecial Rule for Valuing Volunteer Services of a Qualified Representative \nWhen the Treasury Department implemented the cost principles of 2 CFR § 200.306, it provided that \nnotwithstanding the general rule prescribed in § 200.306(e), LITCs may use the rate found in IRC § 7430 to \nvalue volunteer in-kind services, if the following conditions are met:8 \nn The grant recipient is funded to provide controversy representation; \nn Services are provided by a qualiﬁed representative, which includes any individual, whether or not an  \nattorney, who is authorized to represent taxpayers before the IRS or an applicable court;  \nn The qualiﬁed representative is not a student; and \nn The qualiﬁed representative is acting in a representative capacity and is advocating for a taxpayer. \n8 \nSee 2 CFR § 1000.306. \n30 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \nUnless all the above criteria are met, grant recipients should apply the standard cost principles from \n2 CFR § 200.306 as described above. IRC § 7430 provides taxpayers a right to an award of costs and \nfees for services provided by qualiﬁed representatives in suits against the United States when the statutory \nrequirements of IRC § 7430 are satisﬁed. The rate at which to value those services is adjusted periodically for \ninflation. For the 2024 calendar year, the maximum rate is $240 per hour, as prescribed in Revenue Procedure \n2023-34, 2023-48 I.R.B. 445, unless the representative can establish that a special factor, as described in \nIRC § 7430(c)(1)(B)(iii), applies. \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce encourages applicants with questions about how to value volunteer services to contact \nthe Program Ofﬁce for assistance; current grant recipients should contact their assigned Advocacy Analyst. \nBEST PRACTICE \nUtilize various sources of matching funds (e.g., state, local, private, in-kind) when possible to \nensure financial stability. If any one source is unexpectedly reduced or lost, having different \nsources of match will allow a clinic to look to the other sources of match to make up the \ndifference and avoid having to repay federal funds. \niv. Office of Management and Budget Audit Requirement \nA grant recipient that spends $1,000,000 or more in total federal awards during a ﬁscal year is subject to the \naudit requirements established by OMB. See 2 CFR § 200.501. Total federal awards received by the organization \ninclude all sources of federal funding, not just the funds received from the IRS supporting the LITC. The IRS \nmay audit expenditures of LITC funds regardless of the dollar amount of federal funding received by the grant \nrecipient. \nA grant recipient that expends $1,000,000 or more in federal awards during a ﬁscal year must provide the IRS \nwith a copy of the results of an audit performed in compliance with the Uniform Guidance or post it to the FAC. \nIf the most recent audit showed an unfavorable finding, it will not automatically disqualify the grant recipient; \nhowever, more information may be requested to ensure any deficiencies noted in the audit have been corrected. \nGrant recipients subject to the audit requirement must arrange for an audit by an independent auditor in \naccordance with the Government Auditing Standards developed by the Comptroller General of the United States. \nIf an audit is required pursuant to 2 CFR Part 200, it must be organization-wide. The auditor must determine \nwhether the organization: \nn Offers ﬁnancial statements that present fairly its ﬁnancial position and the results of its operations in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles; \nn Maintains internal controls sufﬁcient to reasonably assure that the grant recipient is complying with \napplicable laws and regulations, particularly the laws and regulations that could materially impact the \nﬁnancial statements; and \n31 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

The LITC Program Ofﬁce will consider: \nn Quality of the proposed program; \nn History of performance under LITC grants in prior years, if applicable; \n34 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nn Soundness of the proposed budget; and \nn Any signiﬁcant concerns identiﬁed during the technical evaluation. \nEvaluation of Non-Competing Continuation Requests \nThe LITC Program Office will review all NCC Requests. A risk assessment will be conducted for each applicant \nto determine whether the applicant has responsibly managed federal funds and is likely to continue to do so. \nThe proposed budget, any audit findings, and performance history in the LITC Program will be considered in \nassessing the risk of a grant recipient. The performance history includes: \nn Timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of Interim and Year-End reports; \nn Any significant concerns identified by the LITC Program Office and how the grant recipient addressed those \nconcerns;  \nn Whether the grant recipient’s past activities match its program plan;  \nn Whether the grant recipient has a history of not spending all the funds awarded; and  \nn History of any failure(s) to de-obligate unspent funds promptly.  \nIf risks are identified, the NCC Request will receive a full review. As a part of that review, the NTA (unless \nrecused) may determine whether conditions or additional monitoring are needed to mitigate the risk or whether \nthe NCC Request should be denied. If no serious concerns are identified after a risk assessment is conducted and \nany changes to the proposed program are minor, the NCC Request will be approved. The amount of funding \nawarded will be subject to approval and may be limited by the amount of the Congressional appropriations for \nGrant Year 2025. \nAdditional Considerations \nWhether to award grant funds will be based on the technical evaluation (for Full Grant Applications), the LITC \nProgram Ofﬁce evaluation, and the following additional considerations: \nn Existence of other clinics in the applicant’s geographic coverage area assisting the same population of \ntaxpayers; \nn Scope of services that the clinic will provide; \nn The number of low-income and ESL taxpayers who will be assisted; \nn Languages in which assistance will be provided to taxpayers; \nn Reasonableness of funds sought for the quantity and quality of services to be offered; \nn Other sources of funding available to the clinic; \nn The sources of matching funds that the clinic plans to use; \nn Anticipated funding available to the LITC Program Office for grant awards; and \nn Any non-compliance with all federal tax and nontax obligations, and national policy requirements.

APPLICATION REVIEW\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\n \n \n \nFor organizations that are requesting federal funds to provide representation by referring taxpayers to qualified  \nrepresentatives, award decisions will also consider the following:  \nn The qualifications of the representatives who have agreed to accept pro bono case referrals from the LITC;\nand\nn The ability of the organization to monitor case referrals and ensure that the pro bono representatives are\nhandling the cases properly, including taking timely case actions and ensuring services are offered for free.\nAcademic clinics that carry the additional responsibility of teaching and mentoring students may represent fewer \ntaxpayers than non-academic clinics; however, academic clinics can accomplish LITC Program goals in a variety of \nadditional ways, such as: \nn Providing technical assistance;\nn Training and mentoring other LITCs;\nn Publishing articles about the LITC Program or on tax topics that impact low-income and ESL taxpayers;\nn Commenting on proposed Treasury regulations that affect low-income or ESL taxpayers; and\nn Mentoring graduates and encouraging them to perform pro bono work on behalf of low-income and ESL\ntaxpayers.\nFinal Funding Decision \nFinal funding decisions are made by the National Taxpayer Advocate, unless recused due to a potential or actual \nconflict of interest with an applicant. In recusal situations, the ﬁnal funding decisions are made by the Deputy \nNational Taxpayer Advocate. \nii.\nCivil Rights Compliance Reviews\nAll Full Grant Applications receiving a ranking panel score of 50 points or higher and all NCC Requests undergo \na civil rights compliance review by the IRS to ensure compliance with civil rights laws. Department of Justice \nregulations state that all federal agency staff determinations of civil rights compliance shall be made by, or be \nsubject to review by, the agency. In addition, a Department of the Treasury grant recipient must maintain \nrecords, provide information, and afford Treasury access to records to the extent Treasury ﬁnds it necessary to \ndetermine whether the recipient is compliant with civil rights laws and regulations. For details about the various \ncivil rights laws applicable to federal grant recipients, see Section VI.D.i, General Compliance. \nThe IRS will review all grant applications meeting the above-referenced criteria. To the extent necessary to make \na civil rights compliance determination, the LITC Program Ofﬁce may request that an applicant provide \nadditional information that is readily available or can be compiled in a reasonable manner. \n36 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nUpon completion of the application reviews, the IRS will forward to the LITC Program Ofﬁce a preliminary \ncivil rights determination based on the information in the Full Grant Application, NCC Request, and any other \ninformation the CRU received from the grant recipient. If an applicant has provided incomplete information, \nthe Program Ofﬁce may request additional information from the applicant and provide it to the IRS. No LITC \ngrant funding may be awarded until the IRS has made its ﬁnal determination. \nThe IRS annually conducts selected post-award reviews to ensure civil rights requirements are in place and to \nprovide technical assistance. The IRS will contact grant recipients directly to schedule the reviews. The following \nare examples of civil rights compliance items addressed during post-award reviews: \nn External building accessibility (e.g., accessible entrances, curb cuts, and sufﬁcient parking spaces for persons \nwith disabilities);\nn Interior accessibility (e.g., signage for emergency routes, routes to and within the service area, sufﬁcient \nseating in the service area, restrooms, water fountains, and elevators);\nn Non-discrimination policies (e.g., Publication 4053, Your Civil Rights Are Protected, displayed in service \nareas, and the organization’s non-discrimination policy posted and disseminated in marketing materials);\nn Accommodations for persons with disabilities (e.g., sign language interpreters and Braille/large print \ndocuments); and\nn Accommodations for persons with limited English proﬁciency (e.g., bilingual volunteers, language \ninterpreters/language line, and community resources).\nThe results from the selected post-award reviews are compiled into a report and provided to the LITC Program \nOfﬁce. \nContacting the Civil Rights Unit \nFor additional information on civil rights requirements, see Publication 4454, Your Civil Rights Are Protected, or \ncontact the CRU at edi.civil.rights.division@irs.gov. \n37 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

Selected applicants will be notiﬁed by phone and email. If Congress has passed\nﬁnal appropriations legislation for the 2025 ﬁscal year by November 2024, notiﬁcation of selection will include\nthe amount of the award.

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS \ni. \nStandards for Operating a Low Income Taxpayer Clinic \nThis publication provides baseline standards of operation for organizations funded with an LITC grant. The \nstandards ensure that all LITCs provide consistent and quality service to low-income and ESL taxpayers. \nLITCs are required to ﬁll the following key staff positions: \nQualified Tax Expert (QTE) is, generally, a staff member of the clinic (or a volunteer in the case of the ESL \nEducation Pilot Program). The QTE must have sufficient tax law expertise to oversee technical, substantive, and \nprocedural tax matters. The QTE must be an attorney, CPA, or EA who is currently authorized to practice before \nthe IRS and provide representation on behalf of low-income taxpayers in disputes with the IRS. The QTE is also \nresponsible for reviewing all educational materials for accuracy before distribution. \nQualified Business Administrator (QBA) is a staff member with sufﬁcient business administration expertise to \noversee the clinic’s business operations. If a department fulﬁlls this requirement, as opposed to a single individual, \nplease provide details in the application about the staff member who oversees the department. The QBA must \ndemonstrate education or experience with business or program administration, such as internal controls, grant \nfunds management, budgeting, procurement, or the equivalent. A grantee may outsource part of its accounting \nfunction, but a staff member must still be designated as the QBA. \nClinic Director is a staff member with overall management responsibility for the clinic. The Clinic Director \nmay also be the QTE or QBA, if qualiﬁed. The Clinic Director manages day-to-day clinic operations, prepares \nor reviews the required clinic reports, and may sign reports as the clinic’s authorized representative. The Clinic \nDirector serves as the primary contact person for both the LITC Program Ofﬁce and the Local Taxpayer Advocate \nOfﬁce. The Clinic Director must be able to promptly respond to LITC Program Ofﬁce inquiries and should have \na thorough knowledge and understanding of the LITC’s operations. \nAs a general rule, all key personnel must be employees of the sponsoring organization. Using independent \ncontractors or volunteers to ﬁll key positions must receive advance approval in writing from the LITC Program \nOfﬁce. Utilizing volunteers or independent contractors to ﬁll key staffing positions may be permitted in limited \ncircumstances but only as a temporary measure. The Program Ofﬁce will work closely with the organization to \ndevelop a timeline for ﬁlling the position with a paid employee of the organization. \nAccess to Representation in the U.S. Tax Court and Other Federal Courts \nAll LITCs providing representation services must have a staff member or a pro bono panel member who is \nadmitted to practice before the U.S. Tax Court and other federal courts to represent taxpayers in litigation matters. \nThe Clinic Director and the QTE must not be under suspension or disbarment from practice before the IRS and \nmust be in good standing with all relevant professional state licensing authorities and federal courts. The Program \nOffice will seek confirmation of the status of these individuals before awarding any grant funds. \n39 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

A physical place of business means \na permanent office space where clients can be received and files are kept. Telephones must be answered during \nbusiness hours; however, the telephone need not be answered at the same location as the physical place of \nbusiness. \nIf an applicant proposes to utilize workshare space as a physical place of business, the workshare space must satisfy \nthe following criteria: \nn The clinic must be able to identify it as the clinic’s place of business in letterhead and correspondence. \nn The clinic must have access to a private office and private meeting space to enable confidential conduct of \nbusiness. \nn Taxpayer records or information may only be received and stored at the location if the individual receiving \nthe information has been trained to maintain confidentiality and security. \nn Maintaining confidentiality and security requires that information received must be kept in a secure \nlocation, access must be limited to only those who have a need to access, and those receiving information \nagree to hold the information in confidence. \nApplicants with only a virtual office will not be awarded LITC grant funds. \nProviding a Toll-Free Number \nTo increase access to low-cost representation, grant recipients are encouraged to provide a toll-free telephone \nnumber. Grant funds may be used to pay for a toll-free number. See 2 CFR § 200.471. \nTraining Staff and Volunteers \nLITCs must provide training to clinic staff, volunteers, and other program participants (such as fellows and \ninterns) to increase the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively deliver tax representation, education, and \nadvocacy services. Clinic Directors must ensure that the LITC staff, volunteers, and other program participants \nreceive training based on their knowledge, skills, and experience, and the needs of the taxpayers they will assist. \nClinic Directors are encouraged to develop a training plan for all program participants who provide services to \ntaxpayers. Besides substantive technical and legal training, clinics should provide staff training regarding grant \nrequirements such as determining the amount in controversy and the 90/250 requirement. \nAs part of a comprehensive training plan, the Program Ofﬁce encourages clinic staff and volunteers to attend \ncontinuing professional education programs sponsored by the IRS and professional organizations with expertise in \ntax controversy resolution. Grant recipients may use grant funds to attend such programs if the subject matter is \nnecessary for the performance of the grant and the cost is reasonable. See 2 CFR §§ 200.403(a) and 200.473. \nClinics are also encouraged to conduct Continuing Legal Education (CLE) or Continuing Professional Education \n(CPE) trainings for staff and volunteers. Clinics should track all CLE and CPE related trainings offered for credit. \nCLEs and CPEs sponsored by the clinic will be reported on progress reporting Form 13424-A, LITC General \nInformation Report, under the “Professional Education Activities” section. The details of all other trainings \nprovided by the clinic that are not for credit or are attended by staff and provided by other sponsors will be \nreported on Form 13424-N, LITC Program Narrative Report. \n40 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \nMaintaining Access to Tax Research Materials \nLITCs must have convenient access to an adequate tax library and research materials, including the current \nversion of the IRC and related Treasury Regulations in hard copy or electronic format. Access to research materials \nmay be through online resources. Grant recipients may use grant funds to acquire tax research materials. See \n2 CFR § 200.454(b). \nii. Low Income Taxpayer Clinic Program Office Webinars \nUnless otherwise noted below, the Program Ofﬁce will announce webinars on the LITC Toolkit. The Toolkit is \nthe main way that the LITC Program Ofﬁce communicates with clinics. The password-protected site is accessible \nto all those involved with the clinic, including staff, students, and volunteers. The password is provided to all \nfunded clinics and can be obtained any time during the grant year from a clinic’s assigned Advocacy Analyst. The \npassword is changed annually, and all clinics will be notiﬁed about the new password when it is updated. Some \nwebinars may be geared to speciﬁc individuals in the organization responsible for performing the certain activity \nhighlighted in the webinar. The Program Ofﬁce encourages participation in the webinars and information sharing \nabout the webinars with the appropriate individual(s) associated with the clinic. \nApplication Webinars \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce generally conducts a yearly webinar to provide potential applicants with information \nabout the application requirements and process. The intended audience for the webinar includes applicants \nproposing to start an LITC or expand the work of existing clinical programs. The webinar for applicants \napplying for a grant for 2025 will be held on April 25 and May 7, 2024, from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. ET. Details and \nregistration information will be available at www.irs.gov/litc. Another webinar will be presented to returning grant \nrecipients on May 9, 2024, from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. ET and will focus on changes to the application process and \nhow to submit an NCC Request. This webinar will be announced on the LITC Toolkit. An application Q&A \nwebinar for all applicants will be held on June 5, 2024, from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. ET. Details about this session will \nbe provided on www.irs.gov/litc and the LITC Toolkit. \nAdministrative and Technical Topic Webinars \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce also conducts and coordinates webinars to provide information on general grant topics, \nsuch as requirements for completing grant applications and reports, legal issues impacting low-income taxpayers, \nand substantive topics that will help clinicians advocate for taxpayers. The Program Ofﬁce will also announce \nwebinars on tax-related topics sponsored by other organizations such as the IRS and the ABA Section of Taxation. \nAll webinar announcements will be made through the LITC Toolkit. Although the LITC Program Ofﬁce will \nprovide information about webinars sponsored by other programs or organizations, the Program Ofﬁce does not \nendorse the webinar sponsors or any materials distributed during such webinars. An LITC’s decision whether \nor not to participate in such webinars will not result in the Program Ofﬁce giving any preferential or negative \ntreatment to the LITC. The Program Ofﬁce is merely informing LITCs of training opportunities that may be of \ninterest to clinicians. \n41 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

Annual Low Income Taxpayer Clinic Grantee Conference \nApplicants notiﬁed they have been selected to receive a 2025 grant award must attend the Annual LITC Grantee \nConference, which will be held in December 2024. Generally, the Clinic Director and the QTE must attend the \nconference in its entirety unless the Director of the LITC Program has excused them in writing from attending \nall or part of the conference. The Program Ofﬁce will provide the dates and location of the conference when \nnotifying applicants that they have been selected for an award if the details are known at that time. Information \nabout the conference will also be provided on the LITC Toolkit. \nCost of Attendance \nThe cost of attending the conference (e.g., transportation, hotel, and meals) can be paid with grant funds (or \ncan qualify as matching funds if travel expenses are paid using non-federal funds) and should be included in an \napplicant’s budget. For more information, see Section IV.E.i, Spending Low Income Taxpayer Clinic Grant Funds \nand Matching Funds. LITC grant funds or matching funds may not be used to pay the cost of more than two \nconference attendees. However, an LITC may request an exception to this policy in special circumstances. For \nexample, a clinic is planning to send the QTE and Clinic Director to the conference, but a new staff attorney \nwas recently hired and will devote a signiﬁcant amount of time representing low-income taxpayers. Since the \nthird person will be doing controversy work and the conference provides an economical and beneﬁcial means of \nproviding substantive tax controversy education, the Director of the LITC Program may approve the use of LITC \ngrant funds to cover all or a portion of the cost for attendance of the third person. \nMore Than Two Conference Attendees \nIf a grant recipient wishes to send more than two staff members to the conference, a written request must be \nsubmitted to the Director of the LITC Program within two weeks before the start of the conference. The Director \nor her designee will grant approval to timely submitted requests for additional registrants if space is available. \nIf the grant recipient wishes to seek a special exception to use LITC direct or matching funds to send a third \nindividual to the conference, the clinic should explain the special circumstances that support an exception and the \ncosts associated with sending a third person. The Director of the LITC Program has the discretion to allow the \nclinic to use grant funds for all or a portion of the costs to send a third individual. Without an exception or if an \nexception is denied, any conference expenses (e.g., transportation, hotel, and meals) of additional attendees are the \nresponsibility of the grant recipient and must not be paid using federal or matching grant funds. \nRequesting to Be Excused From Attendance \nIf the Clinic Director or QTE cannot attend all or part of the conference, a request for an exception must \nbe submitted in writing within two weeks before the start of the conference. The request should identify the \ncritical reason for the exception request, and the name, title, and duties of any other person who will attend the \nconference on behalf of the grant recipient. \nAll requests for exceptions related to the conference as detailed above should be addressed to the Director of the \nLITC Program and sent to the clinic’s assigned Advocacy Analyst. The best way to send exceptions is via email \nor e-fax; see Section VII.F, Contacting the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic Program Office. Instructions for submitting \nexception requests can also be found on the LITC Toolkit under Clinic Training → LITC Grantee Conference. \n42 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \niv. Developing a Community Outreach Plan \nLITCs should develop an outreach plan to publicize the clinic and its services to low-income and ESL taxpayers. \nLITCs should also advertise and promote themselves as providing representation and education on behalf of \nlow-income and ESL taxpayers. Outreach activities may involve direct communication with taxpayers or be \naccomplished through contacts with other organizations or community groups that assist low-income and ESL \ntaxpayers. LITCs are encouraged to identify linguistic populations, geographic service areas, or other segments of \nthe low-income taxpayer community in which to focus outreach efforts. \nPublicizing Low Income Taxpayer Clinic Services \nLITCs may use a variety of means to publicize their services, including brochures, flyers, placards and posters, \nnewspaper listings, public service announcements on radio and television, websites, and social media. LITCs \nshould also publicize their program through their organization’s website and community partners. In promoting \na clinic on a larger organization’s website, consider the taxpayer’s experience and how the taxpayer can most easily \nlocate information about the clinic and its services. To reach ESL taxpayers, LITCs should produce publicity \nmaterials not only in English but also in other languages commonly spoken by taxpayers in their geographic area. \nPublicity materials and announcements to advertise LITC services must focus on core services: \nn Representation in controversy cases; \nn Consultations about tax matters; \nn Education about taxpayer rights and responsibilities; and \nn Advocacy efforts to resolve systemic tax issues that affect low-income and ESL taxpayers. \nGrant recipients are encouraged to publicize their program through their organization’s \nwebsite, social networking platforms, and community partners. \nPublicity materials may not advertise tax return preparation services or Individual Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Number \n(ITIN) application preparation assistance. LITCs may prepare tax returns and ITIN applications only in two \nlimited contexts. See Section VI.C.xv, Preparing Tax Returns and Individual Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Number \nApplications. \nLITCs must include a message on their website and in all publicity materials and \nannouncements stating that the clinic does not generally provide tax return preparation. \n43 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

AWARD ADMINISTRATION\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\n \n \n \n \nBrochures, flyers, or other clinic information that may be distributed in IRS ofﬁces or at joint outreach events \nwith IRS functions should contain language to indicate that a taxpayer’s decision to obtain representation from \nan LITC will not result in the IRS giving preferential treatment in handling the dispute or problem and will not \naffect the taxpayer’s rights before the IRS. \nSuch disclaimers need not be worded exactly as above but must convey this principle. In addition, clinics may \nnot use the IRS or TAS logos in any advertising materials. Clinics are strongly encouraged to use the LITC logo \nin all newly-printed or published materials and also on their websites. High-quality electronic files of the logo are \navailable on the LITC Toolkit. The logo should not be altered. \nWith the passage of the Taxpayer First Act, Section 1402,9 IRS employees can refer a taxpayer to a speciﬁc \nLITC for assistance without violating the applicable ethical standards of conduct. Before the change in law, IRS \nemployees were prohibited from referring a taxpayer to a particular LITC practitioner or a speciﬁc LITC for \nassistance with an IRS issue. All IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center (TAC) locations are annually provided with \ncopies of Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List, to facilitate these referrals. In addition, Section \n1401 of the Taxpayer First Act promotes collaboration between LITCs and Volunteer Income Tax Assistance \n(VITA) grant recipients by encouraging VITA grant recipients to advise taxpayers about the availability of LITCs, \nthe eligibility requirements for assistance, and the locations and contact information for the clinics. \nIdentifying Effective Outreach Strategies \nTo enhance efﬁciency and identify effective strategies, LITCs are encouraged to implement a process that tracks \nhow taxpayers seeking services learned about the clinic and the services offered. For example, this information \ncould be obtained on the intake or screening form completed by low-income taxpayers seeking representation \nor advice. For educational activities, the clinic could request that attendees indicate on a sign-in sheet how they \nlearned about the event. The Program Ofﬁce may ask for information as to how taxpayers hear about the clinics \nto share information with the IRS about which forms, publications, and notices are most effective at driving \ntaxpayers to seek LITC assistance. \nv. Building Community Partnerships \nLITCs should develop and maintain relationships with other community-based organizations that assist low-\nincome and ESL individuals. Community-based organizations might include local social service agencies such as \nhuman services, workforce development, or refugee resettlement; community action programs providing heating \nassistance or head start programming; schools, community colleges, religious organizations, domestic violence \nshelters, and senior meal sites. \nEffective community partnerships help LITCs to enhance visibility in the community, access taxpayers in insular \nhard-to-reach communities, better understand nontax issues that affect low-income individuals and families, \nand establish a framework for mutual referrals of taxpayers needing services. Clinics should also network with \nindividuals and groups within the clinic’s sponsoring organization to share information about the LITC Program \nto promote cross referrals of cases and to collaborate on educational activities and outreach opportunities. \n9 \nPub. L. No. 116-25, § 1402, 133 Stat. 981, 997 (July 1, 2019). \n44 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBEST PRACTICE \nEstablish a regular schedule for providing clinic updates to the staff within the clinic’s \nsponsoring organization. For example, provide presentations about clinic activities at monthly \nstaff meetings or distribute a quarterly newsletter to colleagues highlighting clinic success \nstories and impactful outreach and educational events. These regular communications will help \nstaff to remember to identify tax issues in their cases and refer to the clinic when needed. \nvi. Networking With Other Low Income Taxpayer Clinics \nLITCs are encouraged to maintain an active network with other clinics. Networks provide an opportunity for \nclinics to collaborate on tax issues that affect low-income and ESL taxpayers, discuss case strategies, share ideas on \neducation and outreach, and share training on tax practice and procedures. Clinics are encouraged to submit best \npractices developed through networking to the LITC Program Ofﬁce, so they can be shared with other clinics to \nimprove the overall quality of the LITC Program. \nvii. Mentoring \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce encourages experienced grant recipients to become mentors to provide guidance and \ntechnical assistance to other LITCs. The LITC Program Ofﬁce may ask experienced LITC clinicians to consider \nmentoring less experienced clinicians. That assistance may include recommendations for developing processes, \nprocedures, or policies; providing samples of substantive education materials for clinic staff or taxpayers; helping \ndevelop outreach or education plans; and providing suggestions or other feedback on casework. \nviii. Technical Assistance Consultation \nA technical assistance consultation is a discussion with a tax practitioner or other service provider designed to \nprovide brief advice about a federal tax issue. This assistance could be provided to an LITC clinician from another \nprogram, a member of the private bar, a colleague, or a local VITA site member. However, if advice is given to a \nmember of the clinician’s sponsoring or co-located organization to provide to a client about a speciﬁc tax issue, it \nis more properly counted as a taxpayer consultation, not a technical consultation. Grant recipients must report the \nnumber of technical assistance consultations provided on Form 13424-A, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) \nGeneral Information Report. \nix. Maintaining Client Confidentiality \nAvoiding Unauthorized Disclosure \nTax professionals have ethical requirements to maintain client conﬁdentiality. See, for example, ABA Model Rule \nof Professional Responsibility 1.6 and IRC § 7525. LITC employees and volunteers generally must not disclose \ninformation relating to the representation of a client to third parties unless the client gives informed consent. The \nconﬁdential nature of each taxpayer’s information must always be respected, and each employee and volunteer \n45 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

Thus, it is critical for an \nLITC to maintain information security and limit access to taxpayer information to those who need to know. \nTreasury Regulations under IRC § 7216 generally prohibit a grant recipient, its employees, and its volunteers from \ndisclosing or using a taxpayer’s return information except when the tax return preparer has obtained prior written \nconsent from the taxpayer in a manner that complies with the procedures in the regulations and other guidance \nissued by the IRS. See 26 CFR § 301.7216-2. The regulations authorize disclosure or use without consent only in \nvery limited situations, such as pursuant to an order of a court or a federal or state agency, or for preparation or \naudit of state or local tax returns. For unauthorized disclosure or use, IRC § 7216 imposes a sanction of up to one \nyear in prison or a $1,000 ﬁne, or both, plus the costs of prosecution. In addition, the penalty under IRC § 7216 \nincreases to $100,000 in the case of disclosures or uses in connection with taxpayer identity theft. IRC § 6713 \nimposes a civil penalty of $250 for each disclosure or use, up to $10,000 per calendar year (penalty of $1,000 per \ndisclosure or use if related to identity theft up to $50,000 per calendar year). \nClient Information Must Be Redacted From Training Materials \nClient information must be redacted from materials before being used for training. This includes deletion of \nnames, addresses, taxpayer identiﬁcation numbers, and any other information that could reasonably lead to \nidentiﬁcation of the client. It is also suggested that if using a taxpayer’s situation as an example or case study in the \ntraining, the material facts be sufﬁciently changed to prevent identiﬁcation of the taxpayer. The LITC Program \nOffice takes protection of taxpayer information seriously, and thus any materials submitted for use during the \nLITC Grantee Conference must comply with IRS rules for training presentations that explore taxpayer factual \nscenarios – namely that all taxpayer identifying information and tax data used in course materials must be entirely \nﬁctional. IRM 11.3, Disclosure of Official Information, contains instructions, guidelines, and procedures to \nprotect the confidentiality of returns and return information. \nSharing Information With the Media \nGenerally, conﬁdentiality requirements and disclosure restrictions prohibit clinic personnel from providing details \nabout any taxpayer represented by the clinic in response to requests from the media. News reporters and other \nmembers of the media do not have a need to know taxpayer information. The LITC must obtain a written waiver \nfrom the taxpayer before disclosing any of the taxpayer’s information and be sure the taxpayer fully understands \nthe potential ramiﬁcations that could result from disclosing the information, even if the taxpayer is the person \nrequesting that the LITC speak to a member of the media. If the client chooses to share information with the \nmedia, suggest to the client that he or she make it a condition of the interview that the story be produced without \nphotos and names. \nMedia coverage can create a conflict of interest between the LITC and a client. An article that describes the client’s \nsituation and mentions the clinic’s services may beneﬁt the clinic by providing outreach; however, the clinic must \nconsider any potential negative repercussions that publicity may have on the taxpayer. For example, the taxpayer \ncould be dealing with other nontax issues (e.g., custody or child support conflicts, other creditors, immigration) \nthat could be negatively impacted by the media coverage. LITCs should clearly communicate to clients that they \nare under no obligation to share any personal information with the media. \n46 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \n \nx. Recruiting and Supervising Volunteers \nCreating Written Position Descriptions for Volunteers \nLITCs are encouraged to create written position descriptions for volunteers and outline the qualiﬁcations for \neach position, such as whether the volunteer can act as an authorized representative, training and experience, \neducational background, language skills, and other qualiﬁcations relevant to providing representation, education, \nand advocacy on behalf of low-income and ESL taxpayers. \nEstablishing and Maintaining a Pro Bono Panel \nLITCs are encouraged to offer additional taxpayer assistance by recruiting qualiﬁed representatives who agree to \nserve on a pro bono panel, accept cases from the LITC, and represent LITC clients at no cost. Pro bono volunteers \nmay also be recruited for other clinic tasks, depending on their experience and background, such as presenting at \neducational activities, conducting outreach, or supervising students. Clinics may utilize volunteers made available \nthrough national, state, or local bar associations; societies of accountants; and enrolled agent networks. \nMonitoring Referrals to Low Income Taxpayer Clinic Volunteers \nLITCs must have a system to monitor referrals and ensure that pro bono representatives are handling cases \nproperly, including taking timely case actions and providing services for free. Ongoing monitoring is not required \nif referring a case to another LITC. Pro bono representatives may not charge a fee for services (other than asking \nfor reimbursement of expenses such as photocopying and court filing fees). \nReferrals May Only Be Made to Qualified Representatives \nLITCs may only refer cases to pro bono volunteers for representation if the volunteer is authorized to practice  \nbefore the IRS or the court where the IRS controversy will be adjudicated.  \nRepresentation Through Referral \nAn LITC can meet the requirement to provide representation by referring qualified taxpayers to a qualified \nrepresentative. The representative must agree to provide representation free of charge. One goal in expanding \nqualifying activities to allow an LITC to refer the majority of or all cases to a qualified representative is to expand \naccess to unserved taxpayers or underserved areas of the country. These types of LITCs can also help to ensure that \nthe resources of current LITCs are maximized. To the extent that these programs are contacted by taxpayers from \na locality where existing LITC(s) operate, the program should determine whether a local LITC is able to take \nthe case. \nReferrals After Declining a Case \nGenerally, no person associated with the LITC should provide representation in a case the clinic declined. \nAdditionally, employees and volunteers of the LITC may not provide representation for a fee to a client of the \nLITC in a subsequent, separate tax matter. Further, an LITC cannot refer a taxpayer to someone who charges a fee. \nFor example, suppose an LITC refers a taxpayer in a controversy with the IRS to a member of the LITC’s  \npro bono panel. On behalf of the LITC, the pro bono representative resolves the dispute. The same taxpayer  \n47 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

The pro bono \nattorney must decline the case and cannot refer the taxpayer to someone else who charges a fee to represent the \npartnership. Instead, the LITC or representative may refer the taxpayer to a state bar-maintained lawyer referral \nand information service that will provide the taxpayer with an unbiased referral to an attorney who has experience \nin the area of law appropriate to the taxpayer’s needs or an organization that provides pro bono assistance. \nxi. Recordkeeping and File Management \nMaintaining Records of Grant Expenditures \nLITCs must maintain adequate internal controls and retain ﬁnancial accounting records to safeguard all funds, \nproperty, and other assets related to the grant. LITCs must have written procedures for approving expenditures \nfrom grant funds in accordance with the procurement, payment, and cost principles in the Uniform Guidance. At \na minimum, the procedures should address: \nn Which individuals have approval authority; \nn When written approval is required; and \nn What documentation must be submitted for an expense to be approved by the authorized ofﬁcial. \nThe approval process may differ based on the size and type of expense. Also, LITCs must have written procedures \nto track their ﬁxed assets and tangible personal property. To avoid subsequent disallowance or dispute based on \nunreasonableness or non-allocability of an expense, the grant recipient may seek the prior written approval from \nthe LITC Program Ofﬁce in advance of incurring special or unusual costs. Prior written approval should include \nthe timeframe or scope of the proposed cost. The absence of prior written approval of any element of cost will \nnot affect the reasonableness or allocability of that element, unless prior written approval is speciﬁcally referenced \nunder 2 CFR § 200.407, such as purchases of $10,000 or more described in 2 CFR § 200.439(b)(2). Copies of \nany pre-approvals should be retained for three years from the date of purchase. Purchases of $10,000 or more \nshould be noted in the clinic’s ﬁnancial narrative in the year purchased. \nMaintaining Sufficient Detail in Client Records \nLITCs must maintain client case records to demonstrate client eligibility for program services and to document \nthe services provided to taxpayers. In certain situations, attorneys’ fees (including fees for pro bono services) may \nbe awarded in a judgment or settlement of an administrative or judicial proceeding concerning the determination, \ncollection, or refund of tax, interest, or penalty. See IRC § 7430(a). Thus, a clinic should keep detailed \ncontemporaneous case records of its controversy work so that if casework presents an opportunity to make a claim \nfor attorneys’ fees, the clinic has adequate records to support an award. Awards of attorneys’ fees are program \nincome and eligible as matching funds, if spent supporting LITC activities. \nFor each increment of time for which fees are claimed, the records must: \nn Identify the date on which the services were performed; \nn Describe the nature of those services in detail; \n48 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nn Identify the individual’s name and position of any representative for whom fees are claimed (e.g., supervisory \nattorney, student, or paralegal); and \nn Include the associated incremental periods of time spent by that individual. \nThe services provided by the LITC should be described in sufﬁcient detail to enable the IRS to assess the \nreasonableness of the amount of time expended in relation to the service performed and to identify duplicated \nefforts, if any, by multiple clinic personnel. Case records should include classiﬁcations to describe the nature of the \nservices provided. Suggested classiﬁcations include: \nn Initial client interview; \nn Research (identifying issues); \nn Preparation of pleadings or other court documents; \nn Preparation of letters (identifying the recipient and subject matter); \nn Investigation of underlying facts (briefly describing the subject matter and information); \nn Analysis of taxpayer or third-party records (identifying the records); \nn Consultation with tax return preparer (identifying the preparer); \nn Consultation or interview of third party (identifying the person); or \nn Telephone conversations (identifying with whom the conversation was held and the subject matter). \nWhen a claim for attorneys’ fees is submitted, the IRS makes an initial determination as to whether client records \nare sufﬁciently detailed, based on the facts and circumstances of each case. For additional guidance on the recovery \nof attorneys’ fees, see Rev. Proc. 2016-17, 2016-11 I.R.B. 436. \nUsing a Professional Case Management System \nGrant recipients are expected to use a case management system to assist with client eligibility screening and case \nassignment; help monitor the status of ongoing cases; input case notes; maintain accurate timekeeping records; \ntrack controversy outcomes; track case issues worked and where worked; and record educational, outreach, and \nadvocacy activities for Interim and Year-End Reports. Information provided by LITCs is annually reported to \nCongress in Publication 5066, LITC Program Report, and may be included in the National Taxpayer Advocate’s \nAnnual Report to Congress and other IRS publications and reports. The data can help identify trends or systemic \nissues. It is critical the information is complete and accurate. As case management software supports program \nactivities, purchase of this type of software is an allowable cost under the LITC grant. \nBEST PRACTICE \nConsider using a cloud-based or remote-enabled case management system that will allow \nfor remote access if needed. Explore enhancing the clinic’s case management system to the \nextent possible to capture information needed for progress reporting purposes (case issues \nworked, number of tax years involved, etc.) and timekeeping. \n49 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

AWARD ADMINISTRATION\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\n \n \nBacking Up Electronic Files Offsite \nLITCs should have an offsite backup ﬁle system in place for information stored electronically to enable \nresumption of business if a disaster or other work stoppage occurs. Using grant funds to develop a backup ﬁle \nsystem supports program activities and is an allowable cost under the LITC grant. For additional suggestions on \nrisk management, see www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/preparing-for-a-disaster-taxpayers­\nand-businesses and www.ready.gov/business. \nKeeping Client Records in a Secure Location \nClient records must be kept in a secure location (e.g., a locking ﬁle cabinet or password-protected electronic \nﬁles). Before clinic employees, volunteers, or students leave the ofﬁce each day, they must make sure that \ntaxpayer information is stored in a locked area. If it is necessary to take taxpayer information out of the ofﬁce, it \nmust always be safeguarded. In addition, LITCs must have procedures in place to respond to a breach of client \ninformation and must notify the LITC Program Ofﬁce by contacting their assigned Advocacy Analyst if a breach \noccurs. The notiﬁcation should be both in writing and by telephone and take place as soon as is practicable, but \nnot later than two business days from the time of discovery. See Section VI.D.i, Prevention and Response to Breach \nof Personally Identifiable Information. \nRetain Records That Document Compliance \nFederal award recipients must maintain ﬁnancial records and supporting documents to substantiate compliance \nwith grant requirements. Generally, such records must be maintained for three years from the date of submission \nof the Year-end Report. See 2 CFR § 200.334 for exceptions. \nRetaining Client Records \nClient records must be retained for a minimum of three years but may need to be retained longer to comply with \nall applicable IRS, federal, and state record retention requirements. State bars and other professional licensing \norganizations may impose additional recordkeeping requirements for case ﬁles. All clinicians should know the record \nretention standards applicable to them and the clinic and take all steps necessary to ensure those standards are met. \nAsking for Client Suggestions \nLITCs should seek comments from clients about the services received and ask for suggestions about how services \nmight be improved. Many clinics routinely send surveys to clients at the conclusion of a case. It is important that \nwhen seeking suggestions, the information and data received is regularly compiled, reviewed, and considered as \nprogram policies, procedures, and services are assessed and changes are instituted. Comments that do not share \nany personally identiﬁable information may be helpful to include in grant applications and reports. \nxii. Representing Low-Income Taxpayers \nQualiﬁed representatives, as deﬁned in Section I.D, Key Terms and Definitions, must represent low-income \ntaxpayers in controversies with the IRS. LITC grant funds must be used to support that representation. LITC \ngrant funds may also be used to support representation in controversies with state or local tax authorities, if the \nLITC is representing the taxpayer in a related IRS controversy. \n50 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nIntake \nThe intake process enables an LITC to determine whether it can represent a low-income taxpayer. During the \nintake process, LITC personnel collect information from the taxpayer to determine whether the taxpayer meets \nincome and amount in controversy eligibility, and to gather information about the tax problem. The intake \nprocess should involve a robust interview with the taxpayer, which can be conducted in person or by phone. If by \nphone, a toll-free line should be available for taxpayers as well as translation services as necessary. \nLITCs should use an intake form, which can be paper or electronic, to capture the taxpayer’s information. Some \nclinics may ask taxpayers to complete the intake form independently before the interview, while others may \nmeet with taxpayers to complete the form together. LITCs must record the taxpayer’s income information and \nthat of the members of the taxpayer’s family unit, if applicable, on the intake form and solicit information so it \npromotes the development of trust between a qualiﬁed representative and applicant. If there is substantial reason \nto doubt the accuracy of the ﬁnancial eligibility information provided by a potential client, the LITC must \nmake appropriate inquiries to verify the information in a manner consistent with maintaining conﬁdentiality of \ncommunications shared by the applicant. Any information disclosed during the intake process should be kept \nprivate and conﬁdential. \nIf a taxpayer does not meet the LITC’s eligibility requirements, the LITC may not refer the taxpayer to a \nrepresentative who charges a fee; instead, the LITC should inform the taxpayer about a state or local bar \nassociation, society of accountants or enrolled agents, or other tax professional organization that provides pro bono \nassistance. If the professional organization thereafter refers the taxpayer to a representative who charges a fee, the \nLITC has still made an appropriate referral. \nBEST PRACTICE \nInclude an intake question about how the taxpayer learned about the clinic. This information \ncan help determine the effectiveness of the clinic’s outreach efforts. \nAssisting Taxpayers Through Consultations \nMany interactions a clinic will have with a taxpayer seeking assistance will be in the form of a consultation. A \nconsultation is a discussion with a taxpayer designed to provide advice or counsel about a speciﬁc tax matter that \ndoes not result in representation of the taxpayer. An intake interview that does not result in the LITC representing \nthe taxpayer may count as a consultation only if substantive advice or counsel is provided to the taxpayer \nabout a speciﬁc tax matter. Merely referring the taxpayer to the IRS toll-free line or to a VITA site or tax return \npreparation service does not count as a consultation. For the Interim and Year-end Reports, consultations are \ncounted and reported separately from controversy cases. For additional information on reporting consultations, \nsee Form 13424-A, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) General Information Report, and for additional \nguidance on distinguishing consultations from cases for reporting purposes, see Form 13424-K, Low Income \nTaxpayer Clinic (LITC) Case Information Report. \n51 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

AWARD ADMINISTRATION\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nUse an Engagement Letter When Opening a New Case \nWhen an LITC representative makes the determination to open a case after speaking with a new client and \nreviewing the information on the intake form, the representative is strongly encouraged to document it using an \nengagement letter or retainer agreement, signed by the representative and the taxpayer. An engagement letter or \nretainer agreement deﬁnes the speciﬁc matters for which the LITC will provide representation and protects both \nthe representative and the taxpayer by informing both parties as to the agreement of assigned responsibilities \nduring the professional relationship. Clearly deﬁning the scope of the representation protects both the \nrepresentative and the taxpayer from potential misunderstandings about what assistance the representative will and \nwill not provide, particularly if the taxpayer has additional legal issues unrelated to the tax controversy. Written \ncopies of the engagement letter or retainer agreement signed by both the representative and the taxpayer should be \nretained by the LITC and the taxpayer. \nLITCs must respect the attorney-client (or tax practitioner-client) relationship formed when an applicant comes \nin for a consultation. A representative must provide competent representation to a client, act with diligence and \npromptness regarding a client’s legal concerns, and keep a client informed of the proceedings in his or her case. A \nrepresentative who fails to fulﬁll these duties may be subject to punitive actions from the organization responsible \nfor issuing the representative’s license to practice. \nLow-Income Taxpayers and the 90/250 Requirement \nIRC § 7526(b)(1)(B)(i) requires that at least 90 percent of taxpayers represented by an LITC must have incomes \nthat do not exceed 250 percent of the poverty level according to criteria established by the Director of OMB (as \ndeﬁned below). However, the Director of OMB has not established a poverty level or criteria. HHS publishes \nannual Federal Poverty Guidelines based on family unit size and geographic location, which are applicable to the \nLITC Program. See 89 Fed. Reg. 2961-2963 (Jan. 17, 2024). \nThe 90/250 requirement applies only to taxpayers represented in controversy cases and does \nnot apply to consultations or other LITC activities. \nA determination that a taxpayer is low-income does not entitle a taxpayer to representation by the LITC. Rather, \nﬁnancial eligibility is a threshold question each LITC must analyze when determining whether to accept a case for \nrepresentation. Whether to represent an otherwise eligible taxpayer with a controversy is a matter for an LITC to \ndetermine with reference to the needs of the taxpayer, the facts at issue, and the resources available to the LITC. \nLITC Income Guidelines \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce annually updates the income guidelines for the LITC Program in accordance with \nHHS’s annual publication of Federal Poverty Guidelines. Grant recipients must adopt new income guidelines \nwithin 30 days of the date of publication of the Federal Poverty Guidelines in the Federal Register (generally in \nlate January). Based on the Federal Poverty Guidelines, the LITC income guidelines for controversy representation \nare shown in Figure 6. \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \nFigure 6, LITC Income Guidelines \nIncome Ceiling \n(250 percent of Federal Poverty Guidelines) \nSize of Family Unit \n48 Contiguous States, Puerto \nRico, and D.C. \nAlaska \nHawaii \n1 \n$37,650 \n$47,025 \n$43,275 \n2 \n$51,100 \n$63,850 \n$58,750 \n3 \n$64,550 \n$80,675 \n$74,225 \n4 \n$78,000 \n$97,500 \n$89,700 \n5 \n$91,450 \n$114,325 \n$105,175 \n6 \n$104,900 \n$131,150 \n$120,650 \n7 \n$118,350 \n$147,975 \n$136,125 \n8 \n$131,800 \n$164,800 \n$151,600 \nFor each additional person, add \n$13,450 \n$16,825 \n$15,475 \nIncome for Purposes of the 90/250 Requirement \n“Income” is deﬁned in accordance with the deﬁnition used by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

With seasonal workers or taxpayers whose ﬁnancial situation has recently changed, the \nclinic may use a reasonable method to estimate the taxpayer’s income and then annualize that amount. \nExample 1: Determining a Taxpayer’s Annual Income \nA taxpayer seeking representation was unemployed for a year but began working again three months ago \nat a full-time job. The clinic should calculate the taxpayer’s income for the immediately preceding three-\nmonth period and multiply by four to determine if the taxpayer meets the LITC income guidelines. \nExample 2: Determining a Taxpayer’s Annual Income \nA taxpayer seeking assistance works seasonally for eight months each year and cares for family members \nduring the remainder of the year. The taxpayer earns no other income. The clinic should use the amount \nearned over the eight-month period as the taxpayer’s annual income to determine if the taxpayer meets the \nLITC income guidelines. \nDefinition of Family Unit \nFor purposes of the 90/250 requirement, a family unit is generally deﬁned as an unrelated individual or a family. \nAn unrelated individual is a person 15 years old or over not living with persons related by birth, marriage, or \nadoption. A family is a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, civil union, or adoption who \nlive together. However, if related individuals live together, but the person seeking assistance from the LITC is \nﬁnancially independent, then that person may be treated as a family unit, distinct from relatives in the household. \nIf two unrelated individuals live together, they constitute two family units. \nSubject to the general rules outlined above, LITCs have discretion on a case-by-case basis to include an unrelated \nindividual as part of a family unit if that individual could be claimed as a dependent for federal tax purposes in \nthe current year by the taxpayer or another member of the family unit. Clinics should exercise such discretion \nin a manner that is reasonable and consistent. Income of any person in a family unit must be included in the \ncomputation of the taxpayer’s income for purposes of applying the 90/250 requirement. \n54 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \nExample: Determining the Size of a Family Unit \nA husband and wife come to the LITC seeking representation in a controversy with the IRS. The couple \ncares for two foster children who can be claimed as their dependents. The clinic may determine whether \nto treat the foster children as part of the family unit or as a separate family unit. However, if the foster \nchildren are treated as part of a single-family unit with the husband and wife, any state support payments \nreceived on behalf of the foster children must be included in the taxpayers’ income for purposes of \napplying the 90/250 requirement. If the foster children are treated as a separate family unit, the support \npayments would be excluded from the taxpayers’ income computation. \nApplying the 90/250 Requirement to the Number of New Cases Opened \nThe 90/250 requirement applies only to taxpayers who the LITC has agreed to represent in controversy cases and \ndoes not apply to consultations or other LITC activities. LITCs apply the 90/250 requirement to the cases opened \nduring the reporting period. Cases carried over from a prior grant year are not included in the calculation to \ndetermine compliance with the 90/250 requirement. \nIf the LITC agrees to represent the taxpayer and takes steps to begin resolving the controversy, including \ndeveloping a plan for advocacy, the case is included in the total number of cases for purposes of meeting the \n90/250 requirement. The case is counted in the total number of cases even if the taxpayer discontinues the \nrelationship before advocacy occurs. Spouses represented with respect to a joint liability (i.e., arising from a \nMarried Filing Jointly return) are treated as a single case for purposes of applying the 90/250 requirement. \nLITCs apply the 90/250 requirement by comparing the number of cases opened during the reporting period for a \ntaxpayer whose income does not exceed 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines to the total number of cases \nopened during the reporting period. An LITC satisﬁes the 90/250 requirement if at least 90 percent of the cases \nopened during a reporting period are to provide representation to taxpayers whose incomes do not exceed 250 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. \nExample: Satisfying the 90/250 Requirement \nDuring the reporting period, the LITC opened 120 new representation cases and provided 92 \nconsultations to taxpayers that did not develop into a case (i.e., no representation agreement). The 90/250 \nrequirement applies only to the 120 representation cases and does not apply to the 92 interactions with \ntaxpayers that were consultations. Thus, at least 108 of the 120 cases (90 percent) where representation \nwas provided must have been for taxpayers whose incomes did do not exceed 250 percent of the \napplicable Federal Poverty Guidelines, based on the taxpayer’s geographic location and family size. \nDeveloping Acceptance Criteria for Cases Where a Taxpayer’s Income Is Above 250 \nPercent of Poverty \nLITCs have discretion to choose when to represent a taxpayer whose income exceeds 250 percent of the Federal \nPoverty Guidelines, based on the taxpayer’s family unit size and location, provided that the number of such \ncases is no more than ten percent of the new cases opened during the reporting period. The grant recipient must \ndisclose the number of such cases on its Interim and Year-end Reports on Form 13424-K, Low Income Taxpayer \nClinic (LITC) Case Information Report. The criteria used to select cases where the taxpayer’s income is in excess \nof 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines should be reasonable and consistent and support the overall goals \nof the LITC Program – to provide representation, education, and advocacy to low-income and ESL taxpayers. \n55 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

AWARD ADMINISTRATION\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nChanges in a Taxpayer’s Financial Status \nThe determination of a taxpayer’s income for purpose of applying the 90/250 requirement is made at the time \nthe clinic is determining whether to represent the taxpayer. A change in a taxpayer’s ﬁnancial status during \nrepresentation does not disqualify the taxpayer from continuing to receive clinic representation. The taxpayer’s \nfailure to fully report his or her income at commencement of representation may be grounds for disqualification \nfrom representation or may require inclusion in the count of cases over 250 percent, depending upon the \nunderlying circumstances. The LITC should examine the facts and document its decision and the factors leading \nto the decision of how to handle the situation. \nAmount in Controversy Limit \nThe amount in controversy for any tax year generally should not exceed the amount speciﬁed in IRC § 7463 \n($50,000). Thus, while most cases accepted by an LITC should involve amounts in controversy that do not exceed \n$50,000 in any tax year, LITCs may occasionally accept a case where the amount in controversy for a tax year \nexceeds the amount speciﬁed in IRC § 7463. \nThe amount in controversy is the amount in dispute, whether the taxpayer is disputing that he or she owes the \namount (e.g., challenging the validity of the underlying liability or seeking a refund), or whether the taxpayer \nacknowledges owing the amount and is merely trying to ﬁnd a way to pay the amount in full or in part (e.g., \nseeking a collection alternative). The amount in controversy is the amount of the tax liability for which the \ntaxpayer is seeking assistance. \nIf the taxpayer is challenging the IRS’s actions (e.g., alleging that the IRS’s collection action was unauthorized (see \nIRC § 7433)) but is not disputing the amount owed, the amount in controversy is the amount which gave rise to \nthe IRS’s actions which the taxpayer is challenging. \nExample 1: Calculation of the Amount in Controversy – Lien Withdrawal \nThe IRS ﬁled a Notice of Federal Tax Lien under IRC § 6323 when Taxpayer A failed to pay a liability \nfor Tax Year 1. Taxpayer A engages an LITC to represent him in obtaining a lien withdrawal under \nIRC § 6323(j). The withdrawal will remove the notice of federal tax lien ﬁling from the public record. \nWhen the LITC agrees to provide the representation, Taxpayer A owes $35,000 for Tax Year 1. Even \nthough Taxpayer A is not challenging the amount due, the $35,000 balance is the amount in controversy \nbecause it is the amount associated with the IRS action for Tax Year 1 (lien ﬁling) which Taxpayer A is \nchallenging. \nThe amount reflected in a statutory notice of deﬁciency (see IRC § 6212) or a notice of determination (see \nIRC §§ 6320 and 6330) does not always reflect the amount in controversy for LITC eligibility. For example, the \ntaxpayer may receive a notice of deﬁciency for $60,000, consisting of tax liability attributable to three different \ntax issues. If the taxpayer does not dispute one of the issues, the amount in dispute may be less than the $60,000 \nreflected in the notice of deﬁciency. \nExample 2: Calculation of the Amount in Controversy – Notice of Deficiency \nTaxpayer B receives a notice of deﬁciency for Tax Year 1 showing additional tax due of $49,000 and \nassociated penalties of $3,000. Taxpayer B disputes the entire penalty amount and $42,000 of the $49,000 \ntax due reflected in the notice of deﬁciency. The amount in controversy is $45,000 ($42,000 + $3,000). \n56 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nInterest on the Amount in Controversy \nInterest may be included in the calculation of the amount in controversy, depending on the nature of the \ncontroversy. For example, if the taxpayer disputes the validity of a tax liability and related penalties, the interest \ncalculation is a percentage of the liability and will be established once the controversy is resolved administratively \nor in litigation. In that case, the LITC should exclude potential interest from the calculation of the amount \nin controversy. Where the taxpayer is seeking collection alternatives and not challenging the amount due, the \namount in controversy will properly include tax, penalties, and interest. \nExample 3: Calculation of the Amount in Controversy – Interest \nTaxpayer C ﬁles a request for interest abatement under IRC § 6404 for $12,000 in interest that had \naccrued with respect to tax due in Tax Year 1. The tax liability has been resolved. Only the interest is in \ndispute and is, therefore, included in the amount in controversy. The amount in controversy is $12,000. \nExample 4: Calculation of the Amount in Controversy – Notice of Determination Under \nIRC § 6330 \nTaxpayer D receives a notice of determination under IRC § 6330 concerning a proposed levy action. The \nnotice of determination reflects a $40,000 liability for Tax Year 1, a $30,000 liability for Tax Year 2, and \na $20,000 liability for Tax Year 3. Each of the liability amounts represents tax, penalties, and interest. \nAlthough Taxpayer D is disputing the entire $90,000 liability ($40,000 + $30,000 + $20,000), each tax \nyear is reviewed separately to determine the relevant amount in controversy. For Tax Year 1, the amount \nin controversy is $40,000; for Tax Year 2, the amount in controversy is $30,000; and for Tax Year 3, the \namount in controversy is $20,000. \nExample 5: Calculation of the Amount in Controversy – Balance Due \nTaxpayer E receives a bill (a notice and demand under IRC § 6303) from the IRS for $55,000 due for Tax \nYear 1. The amount due is comprised of $40,000 tax, $6,000 penalties, and $9,000 interest. Taxpayer D \nengages an LITC to represent him in submitting an offer in compromise (OIC) under IRC § 7122 for \n$4,000. The amount of the offer is not considered in determining the amount in controversy. Taxpayer D is \ntrying to resolve the balance due, which includes interest. Therefore, the amount in controversy is $55,000. \nIn the refund context, the taxpayer is seeking to collect an overpayment. The amount of interest to which the \ntaxpayer may be entitled under IRC § 6611 will be established once the controversy is resolved administratively \nor in litigation, so interest is not included in the amount in controversy. The amount of interest is not being \nindependently disputed, and the LITC should exclude potential interest from the calculation of the amount in \ncontroversy. In contrast, if the controversy involves a claim for refund of interest already paid, or the taxpayer \ndisputes the amount of interest independently from the associated tax liability (e.g., a claim for interest abatement \nor interest suspension under IRC § 6404), then the LITC should include potential interest in the calculation of \nthe amount in controversy. \nExample 6: Calculation of the Amount in Controversy – Refund Suit \nTaxpayer F ﬁled a timely refund claim for Tax Year 1 for $12,000, plus any overpayment interest allowable \nunder IRC § 6611. The IRS disallowed the refund claim. Taxpayer F engages an LITC to represent him \nin a refund suit in a U.S. district court. The interest is not independently disputed, as interest will be \ndetermined solely by the disposition of the taxpayer’s refund claim. Therefore, interest is not included in \nthe amount in controversy of $12,000. \n57 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI. LITC PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nVII\nVIII\nAPPENDICES\nGLOSSARY",

If \nthe dispute includes multiple quarters for a single tax year, the quarters for that single year should be totaled to \ncalculate the amount in controversy for that year. \nExample 7: Calculation of the Amount in Controversy – Multiple Tax Periods \nThe IRS determined that Taxpayer G is a responsible person within the meaning of IRC § 6672 and \nimposed a penalty for an unpaid employment tax liability arising from Taxpayer G’s business for each \nof the four quarters in Tax Year 1. The liabilities for the penalty are as follows: $15,000 (quarter one), \n$18,000 (quarter two), $10,000 (quarter three), and $12,000 (quarter four). The amount in controversy \nis $55,000 ($15,000 + 18,000 + 10,000 + 12,000) because the four quarters relate to a single tax year. \nRepresenting a Taxpayer With More Than $50,000 in Controversy \nA clinic may represent a taxpayer where the amount in controversy for a tax year exceeds $50,000. However, the \ngrant recipient must disclose the number of such cases on its Interim and Year-end Reports on Form 13424-K, \nLow Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Case Information Report and explain why each case was accepted for \nrepresentation on Form 13424-N, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Program Narrative Report. A case only \nneeds to be reported in the year it is opened. If a clinic intends to accept cases where the amount in controversy \nexceeds $50,000, the clinic must have a documented policy consistent with its organizational mission and is \nencouraged to take a facts and circumstances approach to decision-making. Factors an LITC may consider in its \ndecision-making process may include: \nn Whether the taxpayer has access to other representation if the LITC declines to take the case; \nn Whether the LITC has particular language or cultural competencies that make it especially well-suited to \nrepresent the taxpayer; \nn Whether the issue in the case is of signiﬁcance to the low-income or ESL taxpayer populations; \nn Whether the issue in the case is novel; \nn Whether there is a high likelihood that the amount in controversy is highly overstated; and \nn Whether the case would provide educational value for student representatives. \nIf a clinic intends to accept cases above the $50,000 amount in controversy limit, it must \nformulate a policy and include the list of factors that will be considered in making the \ndetermination. The policy should also include who will make the determination, how it will be \ndocumented, and how exceptions will be tracked to ensure the information is available for \nreporting purposes. \n58 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nParticipation in the U.S. Tax Court Clinical Program \nLITCs are strongly encouraged to participate in the U.S. Tax Court Clinical Program. Applying to participate in \nthe program may be a condition of receiving an LITC grant award. Procedures for participation in the Clinical \nProgram can be found at https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/clinics.html. Clinics will receive notiﬁcation of acceptance \ninto the program from the Clerk of the Court. There are two components to the program: \nn The mailing “stuffer program”; and \nn The calendar call program. \nA clinic may participate in one or both components. Each component has its own rules for participation. \nU.S. Tax Court Mailing Stuffer Program \nClinics approved to participate in the Clinical Program will draft a brief “stuffer notice” containing the clinic’s \ncontact information and advising petitioners of the availability of LITC services. The notice is submitted to the \nTax Court and included in court mailings to local petitioners who indicate they do not have representation. \nSample notices with suggested language and format are available from the Tax Court. \nIf there is more than one LITC that participates in the stuffer program for the Tax Court in a particular place of \ntrial, the clinics must submit a joint stuffer to the Tax Court. Participating in the stuffer program is outreach and \ncan help increase the number of Tax Court petitioners reached by the clinic. Reaching petitioners earlier in the \nlitigation process may help facilitate a much earlier resolution to their tax issues. \nU.S. Tax Court Calendar Calls \nClinics participating in the Clinical Program may also attend U.S. Tax Court calendar call sessions. Generally, \nTax Court calendar calls are held one to two times per year in each city where the Tax Court hears cases, although \nthey can occur more frequently, depending on local need. When the Tax Court grants a taxpayer’s petition \nfor a hearing, the Tax Court sends a notice of trial to each petitioner scheduled for that day and to the IRS \nCommissioner (respondent), approximately ﬁve months in advance of the calendar call. To efﬁciently handle \ncases, the Tax Court typically schedules many hearings on the ﬁrst day of a calendar call session. On the ﬁrst day \nof the scheduled week, each party is “called” before the judge to set hearings and trials and schedule the court’s \n“calendar” for the week. Thus, it is known as a “calendar call.” Some Tax Court hearings are resolved in a matter of \nminutes while others take longer. \nIf a clinic identiﬁes a taxpayer eligible for LITC representation, the clinic can choose whether to limit assistance \nto an informal consultation about the tax issues, offer brief service including negotiating informally with IRS \ncounsel, or enter an appearance (limited or full scope) and represent the taxpayer before the Tax Court. See \nSection I.D, Key Terms and Definitions, Qualified Representative. \nU.S. Tax Court Pre-Trial Settlement Days \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce, members of the IRS Ofﬁce of Chief Counsel, Appeals, Collection, the American Bar \nAssociation Section of Taxation, LITCs, and the U.S. Tax Court continue to work together to create opportunities \nto bring together IRS Counsel, LITC attorneys and pro bono attorneys, and taxpayers in advance of calendar calls \nto negotiate settlement of pending cases. TAS employees also participate in Settlement Days to assist taxpayers \n59 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI. LITC PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nVII\nVIII\nAPPENDICES\nGLOSSARY",

Local Taxpayer Advocates and their staff can work with and \ninform taxpayers about how TAS may assist with other unresolved tax matters, or to provide further assistance \nafter the Tax Court matter is concluded. If a taxpayer experiences difficulties concerning a collection matter, TAS \ncan also assist with collection alternatives. Clinics can learn about such opportunities and work to help set up \nPre-Trial Settlement Days by contacting their local Chief Counsel office or an LITC Liaison committee member. \nA list of LITC representatives on this committee is available on the LITC Toolkit. \nLimited Entry of Appearance \nTo improve efficiency and to encourage the assistance of unrepresented taxpayers, the U.S. Tax Court allows \npractitioners to enter a Limited Entry of Appearance. Limited representation means that the legal services \nprovided are limited in scope and duration to less than full representation. Under Tax Court Rule 201(a), Tax \nCourt Administrative Order No. 2020-03, and ABA Model Rule 1.2(c), an individual admitted to practice \nand in good standing with the Tax Court may file a limited appearance to a date or dates during a scheduled \nTrial Session. An LITC practitioner enters an appearance by signing the Tax Court petition (or other initial \npleading) or by filing an Entry of Appearance or Substitution of Counsel. See U.S. Tax Court Rule 24. For more \ninformation about limited entry of appearance, see the Frequently Asked Questions at www.ustaxcourt.gov/ \nresources/practitioner/lea_faq.pdf. \nRepresentation by Students and Law Graduates \nPractice by students and law graduates before courts and local tax agencies is governed by the procedural rules of \nthe court or agency with jurisdiction over the matter. Clinics should be familiar with and follow the rules of those \njurisdictions. \nEligibility for Special Appearance Authorization for Students and Law Graduates \nPractice before the IRS under a special appearance authorization issued by the Director of the LITC Program \nis limited to students and law graduates at an LITC or student tax clinic program working under the direct \nsupervision of an individual authorized to practice before the IRS. See Delegation Order 25-18 (Rev. 5), \nIRM 1.2.2.15.18 (June 30, 2023). A student is an individual enrolled in an accredited law, business, or \naccounting program. A qualified law graduate is an individual who graduated from law school in 2022 or later \nand has not yet been admitted to the bar of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, including a \nCommonwealth or the District of Columbia. An individual who has applied to sit for the bar but has not been \nallowed to sit due to character, fitness, or moral qualifications does not meet the definition of a qualified law \ngraduate. Similarly, an individual who has been denied admission to a bar due to character, fitness, or moral \nqualifications does not meet this definition of a qualified law graduate. \nLITCs may apply for a special appearance authorization using Form 13424-P, Application for Special Appearance \nAuthorization and Form 13424-Q, LITC or STCP Student and Law Graduate Information letter and faxing them \nto the LITC Program Ofﬁce at 877-477-3520. For more detailed instructions and copies of forms, please refer to \nthe LITC Toolkit website. \n60 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \nSubmitting Form 2848 With Student/Law Graduate Representatives \nFor a student or law graduate to represent a taxpayer before the IRS, the taxpayer must sign a Form 2848, \nPower of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, listing the student or law graduate and the supervisory \nrepresentative. Any Form 2848 submitted to the IRS that lists a student or law graduate as a representative must \ninclude a special appearance authorization letter issued by the Director of the LITC Program or the IRS will not \nprocess the Form 2848. Clinics submitting authorizations that include a student or law graduate representative \nshould check the LITC Toolkit for special submission instructions. LITCs may also submit these authorizations \nonline indicating the form is for an LITC. \nSpecial Appearance Authorizations Automatically Expire \nThe authority of the supervisory representative on the Form 2848 submitted to the IRS will remain effective until \nthe form is withdrawn or revoked. However, the authority of any students or law graduates listed on Form 2848 \nto represent the taxpayer automatically expires 130 days from the day the taxpayer signs the form. \nClinics should avoid contacting the IRS to withdraw any student or law graduate as a taxpayer’s representative \nunless doing so is necessary to protect the interests of the taxpayer. A notice submitted to the IRS withdrawing a \nstudent or law graduate as a representative may result in the IRS inadvertently removing all representatives listed \non the relevant Form 2848, including the supervisory representative. \nSubstituting a Representative \nThe supervisory representative has the authority to assign and reassign student or law graduate representatives to \nthe taxpayer’s case without requiring the taxpayer to sign a new Form 2848 for each substitution, provided the \ntaxpayer checks the box on line 5 of Form 2848 delegating authority to the representative to substitute or add \nrepresentatives. Each time a student or law graduate representative is substituted for an existing representative, the \nclinic should submit to the IRS a copy of the original Form 2848 signed by the taxpayer (with box 5 checked), \nalong with a new Form 2848 listing the substituted representative. The new Form 2848 listing the substituted \nrepresentative does not require the taxpayer’s signature but should be signed and dated by the supervisory \nrepresentative. If another student or law graduate is being added, remember that the student or law graduate on \nthe Form 2848 initially will be limited to representing the taxpayer for only 130 days from when the taxpayer \noriginally signed the Form 2848. If a student or law graduate is being substituted, the authority of the student or \nlaw graduate initially listed on the Form 2848 terminates. The authority of a student or law graduate added or \nsubstituted will expire 130 days from when he or she was added/substituted by the supervisory representative, not \n130 days from the date the Form 2848 was originally signed by the taxpayer. \nIf an LITC encounters difﬁculty with the processing or recognition of Forms 2848 accompanied by a special \nappearance authorization, please contact Rudy Maldonado in the LITC Program Ofﬁce at 559-550-8523 or the \nclinic’s assigned Advocacy Analyst. \nConflicts of Interest and Student Representatives \nABA Model Rule 1.7 provides that a lawyer should not represent a client if the representation involves a \nconcurrent conflict of interest. Students and law graduates authorized to practice before the IRS are treated as \nlawyers to analyze ethics issues. Thus, students and law graduates who plan to seek employment with the IRS \n61 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI. LITC PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nVII\nVIII\nAPPENDICES\nGLOSSARY",

A student or law graduate has \nan obligation to inform clients that he or she is seeking employment with the IRS. Clients may give informed \nconsent, conﬁrmed in writing, to have the student or law graduate continue the representation. If a client does not \nconsent to the student or law graduate continuing the representation, the student or law graduate must withdraw \nthe employment application, or the Clinic Director must assign the case to an individual who does not have a \nconflict of interest. \nxiii. Education \nIn addition to representing low-income taxpayers in disputes with the IRS, LITCs are required to educate \nlow-income and ESL taxpayers about their taxpayer rights and responsibilities. Educational activities must be \noffered directly to low-income and ESL taxpayers, and clinics can expand their reach by educating staff of other \norganizations that assist the low-income or ESL taxpayer populations that the clinic is targeting for education \npurposes. Providing taxpayer education to low-income and ESL taxpayers serves multiple purposes, including: \nn Informing taxpayers about the TBOR, including the right to retain representation; \nn Helping taxpayers to understand their taxpayer rights and obligations and empowering them to exercise \ntheir rights; \nn Informing taxpayers about their eligibility for tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); \nn Publicizing the clinic and its services; and \nn Generating controversy representation cases. \nEducation topics should address tax issues of general signiﬁcance to low-income and ESL taxpayers or of relevance \nin the local community, such as: \nn Tax recordkeeping; \nn Filing requirements and due dates; \nn Eligibility for various deductions and credits; \nn Worker classiﬁcation; \nn Identity theft; \nn Innocent spouse relief; \nn IRS audit and appeals process; and \nn Collection alternatives. \nEducational activities may be offered in a variety of formats; however, LITCs are encouraged to offer face-to-face \neducational activities whenever possible. Using virtual formats for delivering educational activities is encouraged, \nespecially where face-to-face is not possible. These virtual activities may be counted as educational activities for \nthe purposes of Form 13424-A, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) General Information Report, if there is a \nreliable way to count the number of participants and the presenter and participants can interact so questions can \nbe asked and answered. Clinics are encouraged to work with trusted community partner organizations to reach \nthe taxpayer communities with which they are trying to connect. Examples of educational activities include but \nare not limited to: \n62 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \nMaking a presentation about federal taxpayer rights and responsibilities to an ESL class at a local community \ncollege; \nn Presenting a workshop on collection alternatives, identity theft, or worker classiﬁcation at a public library in \na community where a signiﬁcant portion of the residents are low-income or ESL; \nn Holding a class for low-income workers about how to properly complete a Form W-4 for income tax  \nwithholding;  \nn Leading a weekly discussion series at a community center where a signiﬁcant portion of the residents are \nlow-income or ESL on topics such as choosing a competent tax return preparer, determining ﬁling status, \nand claiming credits such as the Child Tax Credit and the EITC; and \nn Presenting a webinar with a live two-way webchat component about identity theft and recent tax scams for \ntaxpayers in remote locations. \nClinics may also offer education to staff and volunteers of community groups or organizations to help them make \nreferrals and spot tax issues that their clients may be having. For example, a clinic may hold training for the staff of \nan immigrant rights organization about how taxpayers apply for and properly use an ITIN. Trainings may also be \noffered to professional organizations as a tool to recruit local qualiﬁed representatives to join the clinic’s pro bono \npanel. Trainings for tax professionals are “professional education activities.” Clinics may award CPE or CLE credits \nfor educational activities about substantive tax issues impacting low-income or ESL taxpayers. All educational \nactivities are reported on Form 13424-A, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) General Information Report. \nEducational Materials \nLITCs are responsible for creating, printing, and distributing the materials used to educate taxpayers. Materials \nshould be accessible to ESL taxpayers and prepared in languages spoken in the community for which the \nLITC provides services. Some educational resources are shared on the LITC Toolkit. The TAS website \n(www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov) also has sample materials on a variety of tax-related topics. The QTE is responsible \nfor reviewing all educational materials for accuracy before distribution, whether they are prepared by the clinic or \nadapted from another organization or clinic’s materials. \nBEST PRACTICE \nWhen asked, many clinics will share their educational materials and will allow other clinics \nto adapt the materials for their use. Collaboration among LITCs helps all clinics to use their \nresources most effectively by enabling them to concentrate on creating new materials on \nselect topics or new areas. \n63 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

Advocacy \nThe third prong of the LITC mission is to identify and advocate for issues that impact low-income and ESL  \ntaxpayers. LITCs may achieve this goal through a variety of methods, including but not limited to:  \nn Participating in advocacy projects with professional organizations; \nn Responding to public requests for comments to IRS regulations, procedures, or guidance; \nn Preparing and ﬁling an amicus brief to alert a court about the concerns of low-income or ESL taxpayers; \nn Authoring articles in scholarly journals or general interest publications on topics impacting low-income or \nESL taxpayers; \nn Appearing on television or radio to raise awareness about tax issues that affect low-income or ESL taxpayers; \nn Producing public service announcements; and \nn Submitting issues to the Systemic Advocacy Management System (SAMS), available through the IRS \nwebsite at www.irs.gov/Advocate/Systemic-Advocacy-Management-System-SAMS. \nTo report these activities, use Form 13424-C, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Advocacy Information Report, \nor Form 13424-N, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Program Narrative Report. Grant recipients must ensure \nthat advocacy efforts do not rise to the level of certain lobbying actions that are prohibited as a use of federal grant \nfunds. See Section VI.D.iii, Lobbying Restrictions. \nxv. Preparing Tax Returns and Individual Taxpayer Identification Number \nApplications \nGenerally, if low-income taxpayers require assistance with tax return preparation or an application for an ITIN, \nthey should be referred to the VITA program, a Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) site, or another free tax \nreturn preparation service. Some IRS TACs will accept ITIN applications and verify taxpayer documents, but they \nwill not prepare tax returns. For a list of TACs that provide in-person document review, see www.irs.gov/help/tac­\nlocations-where-in-person-document-verification-is-provided. Note that TAC ofﬁces are open on an appointment-\nonly basis; appointments can be scheduled by calling 844-545-5640. LITC grant funds cannot be used to fund \nreturn preparation and related activities, such as those performed by VITA or TCE programs. \nAn LITC can help with a federal tax return, a claim for refund, or an ITIN application if such assistance is \nnecessary to resolve a dispute with the IRS or is ancillary to the LITC’s ESL education activity. The clinic may not \ncharge a fee (even if it is a nominal fee) for preparing a tax return or a claim for refund. An LITC or an individual \nassociated with an LITC that does not charge a fee is speciﬁcally excluded from the deﬁnition of a “Tax Return \nPreparer” as set forth in Treas. Reg. § 301.7701-15(f), for purposes of preparer penalties, and is not required to \nobtain a preparer tax identiﬁcation number. \nClinics are prohibited from including tax return, claim for refund, or ITIN application preparation among a list \nof services provided in any advertising materials. See Section VI.C.iv, Developing a Community Outreach Plan, for \nmore information. \n64 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \nExample 1: Permissible Tax Return Preparation – Controversy Resolution \nLITC Q is representing Taxpayer E regarding an OIC under IRC § 7122. Taxpayer E must ﬁle all tax \nreturns she is legally required to ﬁle before the IRS will process an OIC request. Taxpayer E has not ﬁled \nreturns for the last three tax years. Because ﬁling the delinquent tax returns is necessary to have the OIC \nconsidered and to resolve the controversy, LITC Q may assist Taxpayer E in completing her tax returns for \nthe last three tax years. \nExample 2: Impermissible Tax Return Preparation – No Tax Controversy \nAssume the same facts as in Example 1, except the OIC is accepted by the IRS. As a condition of the IRS’s \nacceptance of the offer, Taxpayer E must timely ﬁle returns for the ﬁve-year period beginning with the \ndate of acceptance of the offer. LITC Q cannot assist Taxpayer E in completing and ﬁling her returns due \nafter the offer is accepted because the timely ﬁling of future tax returns is not a tax controversy. \nExample 3: Permissible Tax Return Preparation – Controversy Resolution \nAssume the same facts as Example 2, except Taxpayer E fails to ﬁle a return required to be ﬁled during the \nﬁve-year period beginning with the date of acceptance of the OIC and the IRS defaults the offer. Taxpayer \nE engages LITC Q to represent her in trying to get the offer reinstated. LITC Q may assist Taxpayer E \nin completing the delinquent return because reinstatement into the OIC program is a controversy matter \nand ﬁling the return is necessary to resolve the controversy. \nExample 4: Permissible Tax Return Preparation – Ancillary to ESL Education \nLITC R is conducting a program to inform taxpayers about required recordkeeping for tax return ﬁling \npurposes. LITC R did not advertise return preparation as a service available to taxpayers who attend \nthe educational event. Nonetheless, at the end of the event, one of the attendees, Taxpayer F, asks an \nemployee of LITC R to “look” at her self-prepared tax return before she ﬁles it to determine if it is correct. \nThe employee of LITC R looks at the return and identiﬁes several errors. The employee of LITC R may \nassist Taxpayer F in correcting the return because the assistance offered to Taxpayer F is ancillary to ESL \neducation and outreach. \nExample 5: Impermissible Tax Return Preparation – Not Ancillary to ESL Education \nLITC S holds a monthly workshop about EITC. At the end of each workshop, LITC S’s personnel offer \nto prepare a tax return for attendees eligible to claim the EITC. LITC S may not prepare tax returns \nunder these circumstances because attendees have not indicated there is a controversy for which the \nreturns are required to resolve, and the routine offering of such service does not qualify as ancillary. It is \nimproper to make this offer at the end of each workshop. \nD. NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE \nREQUIREMENTS \ni. \nGeneral Compliance \nBy accepting funds under this grant, the grant recipient agrees to comply with all terms and conditions for the \ngrant, which are governed by: \nn 26 U.S.C. § 7526; \n65 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

In addition, the guidance aims to minimize the time applicants and grant recipients must spend \ncomplying with administrative requirements. The Uniform Guidance was recently updated to further reduce the \nadministrative burden on both agencies and grant recipients and to clarify and simplify the guidance to make it \nmore accessible and readily comprehensible. See 89 Fed. Reg. 30046-30208 (Apr. 22, 2024). \nThe CFR contains all the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the executive \ndepartments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Uniform Guidance is found at 2 CFR Part 200, and \nthe Treasury Department’s implementation of the Uniform Guidance is found at 2 CFR Part 1000. The electronic \nCFR is updated daily and is located at www.ecfr.gov. All applicable provisions from 2 CFR Parts 200 and 1000 are \nincorporated into the program requirements outlined in this publication and into all LITC grant awards. \nStandard Representations (Assurances) and Certifications \nApplicants that create a new registration and existing clinics completing their annual registration renewals are \nrequired to review ﬁnancial assistance representations and certiﬁcations before their registration on SAM.gov can \nbe activated.

Among other objectives, the Data Act aims to simplify reporting for entities receiving \nfederal funds and improve the quality of submitted data. LITC goals are also reported to the USASpending \ndatabase that allows the public to research the use of public funding. \nNon-Procurement, Debarment and Suspension \nSee Section III.C.iv, Debarment and Suspension, for further information. \nDrug-Free Workplace \nLITCs must satisfy requirements for a drug-free workplace pursuant to 41 U.S.C. §§ 8101-06, 2 CFR Part 182, \nand 31 CFR Part 20, Subpart B and C. \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 \nThe Trafﬁcking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, as amended (22 U.S.C. § 7104), requires any agency \nthat awards grants to include a condition authorizing the agency to terminate the grant if the grant recipient \nengages in certain activities related to trafﬁcking in persons. As part of implementing the Act, the Ofﬁce of \nFederal Financial Management has established terms that must be included in every grant agreement. See \n2 CFR § 175.105. \nThe IRS may terminate the award, without penalty, if the grant recipient engages in, or uses labor recruiters, \nbrokers, or other agents in violation of the TVPA of 2000.

See Appendix A to 2 CFR Part 170. \nPrevention and Response to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information \nOMB requires that when a grant recipient creates, collects, uses, processes, stores, maintains, disseminates, \ndiscloses, or disposes of personally identiﬁable information within the scope of a federal award, the IRS shall \nensure that the grant recipient has procedures in place to respond to a breach. In addition, a grant recipient must \ntimely notify the IRS if a breach occurs; see Section VI,C,xi, Recordkeeping and File Management, Keeping Client \nRecords in a Secure Location. Because LITCs have access to the personally identifiable information of their clients \nand their prospective clients, LITCs must have procedures in place to respond to a breach and must notify the \nLITC Program Ofﬁce if a breach occurs. See OMB Memorandum M-17-12, Preparing for and Responding to a \nBreach of Personally Identifiable Information (Jan. 3, 2017). \nCertain Criminal Law Violations \nFederal law prohibits the award of grant funds to any corporation convicted of a felony criminal violation under any \nfederal law within the preceding 24 months, where the IRS is aware of the conviction, unless a federal agency has \nconsidered suspension or debarment of the corporation and determined that denial of the grant is unnecessary to \nprotect the interests of the government. See Pub. L. No. 117-328, Div. E, Title VII, § 745 (Dec. 29, 2022). \n68 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nIn addition, all applicants must disclose all violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity \nviolations potentially affecting the grant award. Failure to make required disclosures can result in any of the \nremedies described in 2 CFR § 200.339, including suspension or debarment. See 2 CFR § 200.113. \nBuy American Act \nGrant recipients must comply with the Buy American Act, 41 U.S.C. §§ 8301-8305, which requires that all \nunmanufactured articles, materials, and supplies purchased using grant funds be mined or produced in the United \nStates and that all manufactured articles, materials, and supplies purchased using grant funds be manufactured \nin the United States substantially all from articles, materials, or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in \nthe United States. A conviction for violating the Buy American Act causes debarment from federal grants and \ncontracts. The requirement to Buy American does not apply to information technology that is a commercial item, \nproducts for which the expected value of the procurement is $10,000 or less, products for use outside the United \nStates, foreign products when domestic products are unavailable or are of unacceptable quality, or foreign products \nexcepted by certain trade agreements. The IRS may waive the requirement to Buy American if its application \nwould be inconsistent with the public interest or the cost would be unreasonable. \nOther Applicable Laws and Regulations \nPrograms involving use of federal funds are governed by a wide variety of federal laws and regulations. These include: \nn Restrictions on political activities (18 U.S.C. §§ 595, 598, 600-603);\nn The national preservation program requirements (54 U.S.C. § 300101);\nn Whistleblower protections (41 U.S.C. § 4712);\nn Rules governing allowable costs (41 U.S.C. §§ 4304 and 4310);\nn Environmental requirements of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7401); and\nn The non-pollution requirement of the Federal Water Pollution Control Provisions (33 U.S.C. § 1251).\nConflict of Interest Policy \nPursuant to 2 CFR § 200.112, applicants and grant recipients must have a written conflict of interest policy that \ncontains the terms as listed in this section. LITCs must promptly disclose in writing to the LITC Program Ofﬁce \nany potential conflict of interest situation and how the conflict was resolved. \nAt a minimum, an LITC grant recipient’s conflict of interest policy (“Policy”) must: \nn Apply to at least the grant recipient’s employees, ofﬁcers, members of its board of directors (including non-\ndirector members of committees), and pro bono panel members (“Covered Individuals”);\nn Apply to at least all grant recipient matters involving the use of LITC grant funds and matching funds, in\nwhole or in part, including, but not limited to, grants, contracts, procurements, leases, investments, other\ncommitments of grant recipient resources, and personnel matters;\nn Cover at least situations when an outside interest, activity, or relationship influences or appears to influence\nthe ability of a Covered Individual to exercise objectivity, or impairs or appears to impair his or her ability to\nperform his or her responsibilities impartially and in the best interests of the grant recipient (“Conflict”); and\n69 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

Managing Grant Funds \nAccessing LITC Grant Funds in the Payment Management System \nGrant funds are paid through the Payment Management System (PMS), maintained by HHS’s Payment Support \nCenter (PSC). PMS allows a grant recipient to make an online request for payment of federal funds. After a request \nis processed and approved, funds are directly deposited into the grant recipient’s bank account through a process \ncalled Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Funds are generally available within one business day of the request. \nAccessing the Payment Management System \nLITC Program Ofﬁce staff can assist new grant recipients with establishing accounts in PMS. Grant recipients \nmust obtain a username and password to use the system and complete a form to set up direct deposit of funds into \nthe grant recipient’s bank account. Information regarding the EFT procedure is available on the PMS PSC website \nat https://pms.psc.gov. For details about seeking historical payment information for audits and other purposes, see \nSection IV.E.iii, Meeting the Matching Funds Requirement, OMB Audit Requirement. \nThe PSC has online FAQs and training. Grant recipients are encouraged to visit the website to view these \nresources. Those experiencing problems accessing funds should contact the help desk at 877-614-5533 or email to \nPMSSupport@psc.hhs.gov. \nObtaining Reimbursement for Eligible Expenses \nGrant recipients may request reimbursement of funds for allowable expenses they already paid or that will be paid \nwithin three business days of receipt of the funds from PMS and must make requests in accordance with their \nactual immediate cash needs in carrying out LITC operations. The timing and amount of EFT payments must \nbe as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the grant recipient for direct program \nor project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. If an expense has been paid, grant \nrecipients are encouraged to draw down those funds as soon as possible. PMS accounts are placed in restricted \nstatus 90 days after the end of the reporting period. If grant recipients attempt to draw down funds after the \n90-day period, LITC Program Ofﬁce management approval is required for release of the funds from PMS. This \nadded approval step may delay release of grant funds. Questions regarding disbursement of funds should be \ndirected to the grant recipient’s assigned Advocacy Analyst. \nBEST PRACTICE \nGrant recipients should regularly draw down grant funds. If funds are drawn down less than \nbiannually, this is often a sign that the organization is not regularly reviewing its budget vs. \nactual expenditures, which is a potential financial weakness. An LITC experiencing difficulties \nwithin the PMS system that it cannot resolve with PMS should contact its assigned Advocacy \nAnalyst for assistance. \n72 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \nGrant Funds Must Be Held in an Insured Account \nGrant recipients must maintain advances of federal grant funds in interest-bearing accounts at a bank with Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage. The balance exceeding the FDIC coverage must be \ncollaterally secured unless: \nn The grant recipient receives less than $250,000 in federal awards per year; \nn The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of \n$500 per year on federal cash balances; \nn The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that an interest-bearing account \nwould not be feasible, given the grant recipient’s expected federal and nonfederal cash resources; or \nn A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest-bearing accounts. \nInterest Earned on Grant Funds \nGrant recipients must annually remit to the federal government any interest in excess of $500 per year earned on \nadvances of federal grant funds and may keep up to $500 of interest earned per year for administrative expenses. \nInterest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts must be remitted annually to \nHHS via PMS. See 2 CFR § 200.305(b)(12). \niii. Lobbying Restrictions \nNo federal grant funds or matching grant funds may be used, either directly or indirectly, to support the \nenactment, modiﬁcation, or adoption of any law, regulation, or policy at any level of government. Some \nexceptions to this general rule may exist pursuant to an express authorization by Congress. There are two types of \nlobbying activities – direct lobbying and grassroots lobbying. \nDirect lobbying includes contacting a member of Congress, a state or local legislator, or any of their staff  \nmembers to influence the legislator to take a position or action on a speciﬁc piece of legislation or potential  \nlegislation.  \nGrassroots lobbying includes activities that encourage third parties, members of special interest groups, or the \npublic to contact federal, state, or local government ofﬁcials in support of, or in opposition to, a legislative policy \nor appropriations matter. This applies to activities both before and after introduction of the legislation. \nAny entity receiving grant funds from another federal source, either directly or indirectly, may \nbe subject to additional restrictions on lobbying. \nGrant recipients are prohibited from using federal grant funds and matching funds to: \nn Visit or send letters to members of Congress, state or local legislators, or any of their staff members urging \nthem to favor or oppose speciﬁc legislation pending under their jurisdiction; \n73 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

In general, an IRC § 501(c)(3) organization may conduct an insubstantial amount \nof lobbying and still maintain its tax-exempt status. See Publication 4221-PC, Compliance Guide for 501(c)(3) \nPublic Charities, available at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4221pc.pdf. \nFor example, a grant recipient may send an email to the ABA-sponsored LITC listserv to gather support or \nopposition for legislation. Although such an email attempts to influence legislation, so long as neither federal \ngrant funds nor matching funds are used, the grant recipient has not violated Title 31 or Title 18 of the U.S. \nCode. If the grant recipient has a requirement under Title 31 to report lobbying activities, the email activity \nwould need to be disclosed, including any research or background work performed in connection with the email \nto the listserv. For purposes of IRC § 501(c)(3), sending a single email to the listserv would likely constitute an \n“insubstantial” amount of lobbying. \nThe grant recipient likely should not have substantial expenditures or have expended substantial time devoted to \nsimple tasks such as sending a single email. Keep in mind that if a grant recipient anticipates devoting, or having \nvolunteers devote, a large amount of time to the endeavor (e.g., researching the issue, drafting proposed legislation, \nresponding to comments on the listserv about the proposal), the activity could rise to the level of being more than \ninsubstantial, in which case the grant recipient may make a lobbying election under IRC § 501(h). IRC § 501(h) \nmeasures the permitted/prohibited level of lobbying solely by expenses. If the grant recipient employee is \nconsidered a full-time LITC employee, then this activity may not be undertaken during working hours. \nFor more information about making a lobbying election, refer to: \nn IRC § 501(h) and IRC § 4911; \nn Treas. Reg. §§ 1.501(h)-1 through 1.501(h)-3; \nn Treas. Reg. §§ 56.4911-1 through 56.4911-10; and \nn Publication 557, Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization. \nClinics receiving Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funds should not confuse the above rules \non lobbying with LSC restrictions. There may be lobbying activities that are acceptable under \nLITC guidance that are prohibited under LSC requirements and vice versa. \nE.  REPORTING  RESPONSIBILITIES \nRequirement to Submit Reports on Grant Activities \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce requires the timely submission of two reports for each grant year – an Interim Report \nand a Year-end Report. The LITC Program Ofﬁce uses the reports to assess the grant recipient’s progress in \nmeeting its stated goals and objectives and to measure the quality of clinic operations, including the services \nprovided to low-income and ESL taxpayers. Quality of operations is measured by determining how well grant \nrecipients support the three prongs of the LITC mission and the related performance measures. The LITC \n76 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \nProgram Ofﬁce also compiles and analyzes data from the reports to assess the overall success of the LITC Program. \nData is then incorporated into Publication 5066, LITC Program Report, which reports the activities of the LITCs \nto internal and external stakeholders, including Congress, and highlights the important work that LITCs perform \nto protect the rights of America’s taxpayers. Thus, it is important that grant recipients provide accurate and \ncomplete reports. \nSubmission of Reports and Other Documents \nGrant recipient Interim and Year-end Reports are submitted online through GrantSolutions at \nwww.grantsolutions.gov. The LITC Program Ofﬁce provides annual training on using GrantSolutions. These \ntrainings are announced on the LITC Toolkit. \nCompleting the Application Amendment Package \nApplication amendments are completed and submitted in GrantSolutions after receiving an NOA indicating \nthe full amount of the award. (The LITC Program Ofﬁce will determine ﬁnal award amounts after Congress \nappropriates funding for ﬁscal year 2025.) An application amendment package is required by all grant recipients, \neven if the grant recipient is not changing the budget or program performance plan. This is necessitated by the \nsystem software. \nThe application amendment package consists of the following: \nn Standard Form 424, Application for Federal Assistance; \nn Form 13424, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Application Information; \nn Form 13424-J, Detailed Budget Worksheet and Narrative Explanations; and \nn Project Abstract. \nIf the grant amount awarded is less than the amount of grant funds requested, the grant recipient must provide \na revised budget (Form 13424-J) with the application amendment package. If the amount requested is received, \nthen the grant recipient will resubmit the budget provided with the application. All grant recipients must submit \nForm 13424-J with the application amendment package. If the grant recipient was awarded less than the amount \nrequested and the difference in the funding award affects the clinic’s proposed activities, a revised program plan \nmust also be submitted. The budget or performance plan may also need to be amended because of conditions \nimposed by the LITC Program Ofﬁce upon receipt of the award or if there have been any signiﬁcant changes to \nthe grant recipient’s operations, such as to key clinic personnel, between the time the application was submitted \nand completion of the application amendment. Changes to the program plan must be provided on the project \nabstract form. If no changes are being made to the program plan for the grant year, the grant recipient must \nindicate, “No changes to the program plan.” “Not Applicable” is not a sufficient response. \nThe project abstract must also include the four numerical goals requested from all grant recipients: \nn New representation cases to be opened in the calendar year; \nn Consultations with low-income and ESL taxpayers; \nn Educational activities for low-income and ESL taxpayers; and \nn Low-income and ESL taxpayers to be reached in educational activities. \n77 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

AWARD ADMINISTRATION\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\n i. \nEvents Requiring Notification to the LITC Program Office \nAn award of less than the applicant’s requested funding amount is based on several factors, including the \nproposed goals in the application. The grant recipient should consult with the assigned Advocacy Analyst before \namending the clinic’s program plan in response to receipt of less than the requested grant amount, especially when \ncontemplating reductions in proposed activities and goals, to determine whether these changes are likely to be \napproved. The Program Office may also request additional information be submitted with the project abstract. \nThe application amendment will also need to be revised during the grant year if there are certain enumerated \nchanges discussed in Section VI.E.i., Events Requiring Notification to the LITC Program Office. Upon notification \nof the changes, the assigned Advocacy Analyst will return the application amendment package back to the grant \nrecipient so the changes can be made and the package resubmitted. The Program Office will offer a training session \nabout the application amendment process after NOAs are issued; the date and time will be announced on the \nLITC Toolkit. A short instructional video about completing Form 1324-J is also available on the LITC Toolkit. \nSome anticipated changes should be discussed with the LITC Program Ofﬁce as far in advance of the anticipated \nchange as possible, as some changes may not be allowable and/or may impact the clinic’s eligibility to draw down \nfurther grant funds. Changes may also have an impact on funding decisions for a pending LITC grant application. \nThis section discusses some changes that a clinic may experience. To report changes or anticipated changes \nrequiring advanced notice, grant recipients should contact their assigned Advocacy Analyst via email, including a \ncopy to LITCProgramOfﬁce@irs.gov. The Advocacy Analyst will respond and request a time to discuss the matter \nwith the grant recipient. For items that require the grant recipient to revise the application amendment package, \nthe Advocacy Analyst will return the package to the grant recipient via GrantSolutions and schedule a due date for \nresubmission. \nChanges in Entity or Sponsoring Organization \nGrant recipients must notify the LITC Program Ofﬁce if the clinic or the clinic’s sponsoring organization plans \nto change its type of entity, including a merger with another clinic or organization. This notiﬁcation shall inform \nthe LITC Program Ofﬁce of the planned entity changes or merger event, including the name and identifying \ninformation of any new organization involved or being formed, a timeline for the change or merger, and the name \nand contact information for the person the Program Ofﬁce should contact with questions. \nIf a merger occurs, the Program Ofﬁce may substitute another organization for the original sponsoring organization \nbut not before conﬁrming that the substitute organization has received the original sponsoring organization’s \nassets, the substitute organization’s clinic will provide the same scope of services to the same population as serviced \nor proposed to be serviced in the grant recipient’s application, and the substitute organization is qualiﬁed under \nthe relevant statutes and regulations to be an LITC grant recipient. The Program Ofﬁce may not be deemed as \napproving any entity change or merger until such approval is received in writing from the Director of the LITC \nProgram. The grant recipient is encouraged to notify the Program Ofﬁce as early in the entity change or merger \nprocess as possible so the two can timely work through the issues and, hopefully, limit any lapse in funding. \nFailure to timely notify the Program Ofﬁce of a potential entity change or merger may result in restriction of \nfunds or suspension or termination of the grant, see Section VIII, Award Modification, Suspension, Termination, or \nWithdrawal. \n78 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nSignificant Changes in Clinic Operations \nGrant recipients must notify the LITC Program Ofﬁce with problems, delays, or adverse conditions that \nsigniﬁcantly affect operations of the clinic or materially impair its ability to meet the objectives of the award. \nThis notiﬁcation shall inform the Program Ofﬁce of events, such as those described in this section, that may \nsigniﬁcantly affect operations and include a statement of the action taken or contemplated to address the \nsituation, and whether any assistance from the Program Ofﬁce is needed to resolve the situation. Failure to notify \nthe Program Ofﬁce may result in restriction of funds or suspension or termination of the grant, see Section VIII, \nAward Modification, Suspension, Termination, or Withdrawal. \nChanges in Clinic or Key Personnel Contact Information \nGrant recipients must immediately notify the LITC Program Ofﬁce about proposed changes in contact \ninformation for the following: \nn Key personnel, including the Clinic Director, QTE, or QBA (including their telephone number, mailing \naddress, or email address); and \nn Clinic address (both the physical address and the mailing address), telephone number, or fax number. \nThese notiﬁcations ensure that the LITC Program Ofﬁce has the most up-to-date information for each clinic and \ncan also update information in IRS online resources and printed publications. \nChanges in Program Plan or Budget Under 2 CFR § 200.308 \nGrant recipients are expected to spend grant funds and matching funds in accordance with the program plan and \nbudget submitted with their application, or as later revised and approved. Grant recipients must request approval \nfrom the LITC Program Ofﬁce for any substantial change in the program plan or budget. A substantial change in \nthe program plan or budget includes a change to: \nn The scope or objective of the program; \nn The days and hours of operation; \nn The beginning and ending dates clinic services will be provided; \nn Key personnel or time devoted to the LITC by key personnel; and \nn The amount or composition of matching funds (cash or third-party in-kind match). \nGrant recipients are responsible for monitoring the use of LITC grant funds throughout the year to ensure that \nall grant funds awarded will be expended. If a grant recipient determines that it will have unused grant funds \n(i.e., not spend its entire award), the grant recipient should immediately notify the assigned Advocacy Analyst in \nwriting. The notiﬁcation should contain the following information: \nn The amount of grant funds being returned; \nn The reason for the return of funds; and \nn The impact the return of funds will have on future operations (e.g., this is a one-time occurrence or the grant \nrecipient anticipates a permanent reduction in its future funding needs). \n79 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

The Interim Report covers the \nfirst half of the grant year (January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2025) and consists of the following items, prepared \nin accordance with the instructions: \nn Form 13424-A, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) General Information Report; \nn Form 13424-K, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Case Information Report; \nn Form 13424-L, Statement of Grant Expenditures and Narrative Explanations; and \nn Form 13424-N, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Program Narrative Report. \nClinics no longer submit the following forms as a part of the Interim Report but will continue to track data and \nsubmit these forms with the Year-end Report: \nn Standard Form 425, Federal Financial Report; \nn Form 13424-B, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Case Issues Report; and \nn Form 13424-C, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Advocacy Information Report. \n* If you operated an ESL Education Pilot Program only, you are required to submit the following at interim:  \nForm 13424-A (excluding sections 6-10), Form 13424-L, and Form 13424-N (excluding section 2.v-2.vii).  \nIf the clinic provided any consultations or casework assistance during the grant year, then all forms need to be  \ncompleted in their entirety.  \nFor reference, copies of all required reporting forms and instructions are included in Appendix B. However, grant \nrecipients must complete and submit reporting forms in GrantSolutions. If not completing an entry on one of the \nforms results in a GrantSolutions submission error, list N/A to address the issue. \n80 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \niii. Submitting the Year-end Report* \nA Year-end Report must be submitted online through GrantSolutions by March 31, 2026. The Year-end Report \ncovers the entire grant year (January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025), with one exception. See Form \n13424-N in the list below. A complete Year-end Report consists of the following items, prepared in accordance \nwith the instructions: \nn Standard Form 425, Federal Financial Report; \nn Form 13424-A, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) General Information Report; \nn Form 13424-B, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Case Issues Report; \nn Form 13424-C, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Advocacy Information Report; \nn Form 13424-K, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Case Information Report; \nn Form 13424-L, Statement of Grant Expenditures and Narrative Explanations; and \nn Form 13424-N, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Program Narrative Report. For sections 3 & 4, report \nemerging issues and success stories from the second half of the year only. \nSubject to OMB approval, the LITC Program Ofﬁce may require additional reporting information from LITCs. \nGrant recipients should refer to the LITC Toolkit for updates on reporting requirements prior to submitting their \nreports. Training sessions will be offered to all grant recipients in advance of when each report is due, and details \nfor the sessions will be announced on the LITC Toolkit. \n* If you operated an ESL Education Pilot Program only, you are required to submit the following at interim and \nyear-end: Standard Form 425, Form 13424-A (excluding sections 6-10), Form 13424-C, Form 13424-L, and \nForm 13424-N (excluding section 2.v-2.vii). If the clinic provided any consultations or casework assistance during \nthe grant year, then all forms need to be completed in their entirety. \nLate Submissions \nIn certain instances, grant recipients may request an extension of time to submit the Interim or Year-end Report. \nHowever, a report will still be considered late if submitted after the due date, notwithstanding any extension \nthat may be granted. The request must be submitted in writing to the LITC Program Ofﬁce before the due date \nof the report and must include an explanation justifying the extension and the date by which the report will \nbe submitted. Grant recipients should contact their assigned Advocacy Analyst via email, including a copy to \nLITCProgramOfﬁce@irs.gov, to submit an extension request. Failure to timely submit required reports to the \nLITC Program Ofﬁce may result in any or all the following: \nn Restricted access to grant funds; \nn Suspension or termination of the grant; or \nn Reduction of any future award amount. \n81 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

Grant Closeout \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce will close out the LITC grant award when it determines that all applicable \nadministrative actions and activities related to the grant have been completed by the grant recipient. Before a grant \nmay be closed out, the following actions must be completed per 2 CFR § 200.344: \nn Submission by the grant recipient of all required Interim and Year-end Report forms; \nn Liquidation by the grant recipient of all obligations incurred under the award no later than 120 calendar \ndays (unless the LITC Program Office authorizes an extension) after the end date of the period of \nperformance; \nn Draw down by the grant recipient of payment for all allowable reimbursable costs; \nn Repayment by the grant recipient of any balances of unobligated cash drawn down by the grant recipient; \nand \nn Settlement of any adjustments to the grant award to account for any shortfall in the dollar-for-dollar \nmatching funds requirement. \nThe Program Office must make every effort to complete closeout actions no later than one year after the end of \nthe period of performance. If the grant recipient fails to complete the requirements to close out, the Program \nOffice will close out the award with the information available. If the grant recipient does not submit all required \nreports and forms within one year of the period of performance end date, the LITC Program Office must report \nthe grant recipient’s material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award with the OMB-\ndesignated integrity and performance system (FAPIIS). Per 2 CFR § 200.339, other enforcement actions may also \nbe pursued at the discretion of the Program Office. \nBy accepting the NOA, the grant recipient authorizes the LITC Program Ofﬁce to take steps to de-obligate \nfunds without the need for the grant recipient to execute a new NOA, budget, or reporting forms if the amount \ninvolved is less than $25. The Program Ofﬁce will notify the clinic via email of the planned action 30 days prior \nto taking the action, and a de-obligation will not be initiated any earlier than September 1 of the year following \nthe close of the budget period. \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n                                  \nVII.

ADMINISTRATION \nThe LITC Program Office administers the grant by: \nn Processing LITC grant applications and making awards to successful applicants; \nn Revising and issuing annually Publication 3319, LITC Grant Application Package and Guidelines; \nn Maintaining the LITC Toolkit, a password-protected website used to disseminate program guidance and \nprovide resources to assist clinics in assisting low-income and ESL taxpayers; \nn Maintaining Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List, a list of all federally-funded LITCs, and \nensuring that the publication is included in IRS mailings, referenced in IRS publications and notices, and \navailable at TACs; \nn Updating information about the LITC Program on IRS and TAS websites, including an interactive LITC \nfinder tool on https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/about-us/low-income-taxpayer-clinics-litc/; \nn Publishing annually Publication 5066, LITC Program Report, which reports the activities of the LITCs to \ninternal and external stakeholders; and \nn Reviewing and analyzing data from reports submitted by grant recipients to identify trends and recognize \nbest practices. \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce assists by: \nC. ASSISTANCE \nn Providing technical assistance and guidance to grant recipients and potential applicants; \nn Informing the public about the availability of LITCs, to the extent permitted by law; \nn Sponsoring and organizing the Annual LITC Grantee Conference to deliver instruction and continuing \neducation to all grant recipients and provides an opportunity for attendees to connect with colleagues from \nLITCs throughout the country to share ideas and strategies to better assist low-income and ESL taxpayers; \nn Conducting orientation visits to familiarize new grant recipients with LITC Program requirements and to \nidentify potential areas where the clinic may need to create systems or improve processes; \nn Fostering the working relationship between grant recipients and LTA ofﬁces; \nn Issuing special appearance authorizations to LITCs that permit students and law graduates working under \nthe supervision of a practitioner to represent taxpayers before the IRS; \nn Coordinating grant recipients’ access to e-Services products offered by the IRS; and \nn Assisting with resolution of problems that grant recipients may experience with GrantSolutions. \nD. OVERSIGHT \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce conducts oversight of grant recipients by: \nn Reviewing Interim and Year-end Reports to assess grant recipients’ progress in meeting program goals, \ncollecting emerging issues identiﬁed, and aggregating performance data submitted by grant recipients; \n84 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \nn Reviewing budgets and ﬁnancial reports submitted by grant recipients to ensure that federal funds are \nproperly expended and that matching funds are properly sourced, spent, and valued; and \nn Conducting operational review visits to interview clinic personnel, observe facilities, review procedures and \ninternal controls, corroborate report information, and evaluate operations. \nE. SITE ASSISTANCE VISITS \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce or the LTA conducts a site assistance visit to each grant recipient every year. There are \nthree types of site assistance visits: \nn Orientation visit; \nn Operational review visit; and \nn LTA visit. \nOrientation Visits \nThe LITC Program Ofﬁce conducts an orientation visit to each grant recipient that did not receive a grant in the \npreceding year. The orientation visit will generally occur during the ﬁrst 120 days of the grant year. An orientation \nvisit provides an opportunity to familiarize a new grant recipient with LITC Program requirements and to measure \nthe progress of its startup activities. During the visit, the staff of the LITC Program Ofﬁce will discuss accounting \nprocedures and internal controls with the new grant recipient and perform a limited sampling of records and \nexpense documentation to ensure that the controls are in place and being used appropriately. The orientation \nvisit also allows the staff to assess the status of newly funded clinics and to identify potential areas where the grant \nrecipient may need to create systems or improve processes to meet the requirements of the LITC Program. \nDuring the orientation visit, discussions about the clinic’s ﬁnances will incorporate accounting and ﬁnancial \ncontrols as documented on the pre-visit assessment/site visit plan prepared by the Advocacy Analyst prior to the \nvisit. Speciﬁcally, the Program Ofﬁce reviews at least one receipt and invoice at random and other supporting \ndocumentation, including approvals and reimbursements for the LITC conference travel, if available. In addition, \nLITC Program Ofﬁce staff samples at random personnel expenses, if any, from the ﬁrst quarter of the current \ngrant year. As there will be no report for comparison, the primary purpose of this sampling provides a basis for \ndiscussing ﬁnancial recordkeeping and determine how well the clinic is following policies and procedures. \nOperational Review Visits \nThe purpose of an operational review visit is to evaluate a clinic’s overall operations and to provide technical \nassistance to help the grant recipient maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of the LITC grant. \nThe visit may include the review of documents, papers, or other records of the grant recipient. OMB regulations \nrequire that the IRS must have the right to access any documents, papers, or other records of a grant recipient \npertinent to the award to make audits and examinations. See 2 CFR § 200.337(a). The Treasury Department \nimplemented a regulation making it clear that “[t]he right of access under 2 CFR § 200.337 shall not extend to \nclient information held by attorneys or federally authorized tax practitioners under the Low Income Taxpayer \nClinic program.” See 2 CFR § 1000.337.

Therefore, the LITC Program \nOfﬁce will not require LITCs to provide access to taxpayer-speciﬁc information for auditing or verifying that the \n90/250 requirement has been satisﬁed, or that the amounts in controversy generally do not exceed the amount \nspeciﬁed in IRC § 7463. In addition, the LITC Program Ofﬁce will not require an LITC to provide access to \ninformation a taxpayer provided to the LITC during a consultation that did not result in the taxpayer executing a \nrepresentation agreement. Prior to an operational review visit, however, the assigned Advocacy Analyst will require \nthe clinic to complete an LITC Site Assistance Visit – Case Eligibility Requirements Tracking Form to collect \ndata on eligibility decisions made by the clinic during the grant year but does not request any taxpayer identifying \ninformation such as taxpayer names or identiﬁcation numbers. \nIf the LITC Program Ofﬁce identiﬁes a concern with a clinic’s procedure for collecting ﬁnancial eligibility \nor amount in controversy information and making eligibility determinations, the LITC Program Ofﬁce staff \nmember conducting an operational review visit may decide to randomly sample the ﬁnancial eligibility or amount \nin controversy determinations made by the clinic staff. This will be done by asking the clinic to generate a list \nof cases accepted for representation by a unique identiﬁer for the timeframe that is under review. The unique \nidentiﬁer should not be the taxpayer’s name or taxpayer identiﬁcation number. Using a clinic staff member as \nan intermediary, the LITC Program Ofﬁce staff visiting will randomly select a few cases to review and will ask \nthe intermediary to pull the case ﬁle information. The LITC Program Ofﬁce staff will then ask the intermediary \nto answer questions about what is recorded for the applicant, including the household composition, household \nincome, and the amount in controversy. \nDuring an operational review visit, the grant recipient’s assigned Advocacy Analyst will interview clinic personnel, \nexamine intake procedures, review case management and reporting systems, and sample ﬁnancial records. An \noperational review visit may also include observation of clinic facilities and review of procedures and internal \ncontrols, personnel policies, training plans, privacy and conﬁdentiality policies, outreach plans and materials, \neducational curricula, fee policies, and client satisfaction instruments. \nBy supporting and monitoring the work of LITCs, the Program Ofﬁce staff builds a relationship with clinicians \nto create trust and encourage the LITCs to seek guidance and assistance from the Program Ofﬁce. Generally, the \nProgram Ofﬁce will visit each LITC at least once every three years. The Program Ofﬁce may visit at any time and \nmore often if an assessment of the clinic indicates that more close monitoring is necessary and best accomplished \nby additional visits. \nLocal Taxpayer Advocate Visits \nThe LTA assigned to a clinic must visit at least once a year. If the LTA participates in a visit with the Program \nOfﬁce, the LTA will be provided with time during the visit to discuss current issues, collaborations, or other \ntopics of mutual interest. In a year when the LTA does not accompany the LITC Program Ofﬁce on an \norientation visit or an operational review visit, the LTA must conduct an LTA visit. The purpose of the LTA \nvisit is to foster the relationship between the LTA’s ofﬁce and the clinic by providing an opportunity to share \nemerging case issues and ideas to collaborate on joint education and outreach activities. \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nF.

The LITC Program Ofﬁce may become aware of clinics’ non-compliance through reviews of \nclinic reports, site assistance visits, or other interactions with grant recipients. If the clinic fails to meet its \nobligations under the terms and conditions of the grant, the LITC Program Ofﬁce may reduce an award \namount, delay release of funds, or suspend or terminate a grant in whole or in part. Prior to taking such steps, \nthe IRS will determine whether imposing additional conditions upon the grant recipient is likely to remedy the \nnon-compliance. A grant award may also be terminated with the consent of the grant recipient, in which case the \ntwo parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial \ntermination, the portion to be terminated. Notwithstanding that a multiyear grant has been awarded under \nIRC § 7526(c)(3), the IRS may terminate a grant during the multiyear period. \nActions that may lead to a reduced award, delay in receiving grant funds, suspension, or termination include: \nn Failure to comply with federal tax and nontax obligations, or the applicant does not have an active SAM \nregistration or is suspended or debarred; \nn Failure to satisfy the 90/250 requirement of IRC § 7526(b)(1)(B)(i); \nn Failure to provide matching funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis for all LITC grant funds awarded; \nn A violation by the grant recipient of a material provision of IRC § 7526 or other applicable law or regulation \n(including the Uniform Guidance); \nn A violation by the grant recipient of a material provision of the Publication 3319, LITC Grant Application \nPackage and Guidelines (for example, failure to timely ﬁle complete and accurate reports); \nn Failure to maintain taxpayer information in a secure manner; and \nn Failure to provide accurate and competent representation to taxpayers, where competent representation \nrequires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary to provide effective \nassistance. See ABA Model Rule 1.1, Competence, and Model Rule 1.3, Diligence. \nNOTE: 2 CFR § 200.340 strengthens the ability of the LITC Program Office to terminate federal awards, to the \ngreatest extent authorized by law, when the federal award no longer effectuates the program goals. \nRemedies for Noncompliance \nIf a grant recipient violates the federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions in the Notice Award, the \nLITC Program Ofﬁce may impose additional conditions, as described in 2 CFR § 200.208. If the LITC Program \nOfﬁce determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions, the LITC Program \nOfﬁce may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances: \nn Temporarily restrict access to grant funds pending correction of the noncompliance or more severe \nenforcement action; \nn Disallow all or part of certain cost items, including grant expenditures and matching funds, that support the \nactivity or action not in compliance and seek recovery of improperly spent funds (plus any interest); \nn Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the grant; \n89 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI.

AWARD SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION\nVII\nVI\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nn Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR Part 180; \nn Withhold a future award amount; or \nn Take other remedies that may be legally available. \nNotification of Grant Suspension or Termination \nSuspension or termination of a grant award will be handled in accordance with the Uniform Guidance. The LITC \nProgram Ofﬁce will notify the grant recipient in writing of any suspension or termination action, setting forth the \nreasons for such action and the effective date. The notiﬁcation will advise the grant recipient of its right to object \nto the suspension or termination action by providing information and documentation in writing to challenge the \nbasis for the action. \nChallenging a Suspension or Termination \nIf a grant recipient wishes to challenge the LITC Program Ofﬁce’s decision to suspend or terminate a grant, \nit must send a written request to the Director of the LITC Program for reconsideration of the suspension or \ntermination decision. The grant recipient may provide information and documentation for review during the \nreconsideration. The Director of the LITC Program will review the submission and make a recommendation to \nthe National Taxpayer Advocate, who has ﬁnal decision making authority, unless recused. In recusal situations, a \nﬁnal decision will be made by the Deputy National Taxpayer Advocate. \nIRC § 7526 does not require the IRS to provide grant recipients an opportunity for a hearing or an appeal. \nTherefore, the necessity for renegotiation, suspension, or termination of a grant agreement will be determined \nsolely by the IRS. The decision of the National Taxpayer Advocate (or the Deputy National Taxpayer Advocate in \nrecusal situations) when an LITC challenges the Program Ofﬁce’s decision is ﬁnal. \nResponsibilities Following Termination or Withdrawal \nIf the LITC Program Ofﬁce terminates a grant, the grant recipient must submit a ﬁnal Year-end Report to the \nLITC Program Ofﬁce within 90 days of the termination. Similarly, if clinic activity is terminated prior to the \nexpiration of the period of the grant agreement or if a grant recipient withdraws from the LITC Program, a ﬁnal \nYear-end report must be submitted within 90 days of ﬁnal clinic activity or withdrawal from the LITC Program. \nAll unused funds must be repaid to the IRS within 30 days of the date of withdrawal or the date of termination. \nThe federal government is generally obligated to charge interest on any amount not repaid promptly. See \n31 CFR § 901.9. Thus, for any funds the LITC Program Ofﬁce requests to be returned to the IRS, failure to \nrepay those funds on time may result in the grant recipient having to pay interest on those funds. \nEmployees and volunteers of the clinic who are lawyers must adhere to their responsibilities as attorneys, not just \nthe responsibilities within the parameters of the LITC Program. The ABA has model rules of professional conduct \nthat are applicable when a lawyer is terminating representation. ABA Model Rule 1.16 provides that upon \nterminating representation of a client, a lawyer must take reasonable steps to protect a client’s interests, which \nincludes giving notice to the client, allowing the client time to ﬁnd other representation, and returning papers and \nproperty to the client. The state bar may have a similar rule of professional responsibility that provides guidance \nfor terminating representation. Courts, such as the U.S. Tax Court, require the ﬁling of a motion for leave to \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nwithdraw as counsel. See U.S. Tax Court Rule 24. In addition, if the clinic will no longer participate in the U.S. \nTax Court Clinical Program (including the Calendar Calls), the clinic must notify the Tax Court so it will cease \nreferring taxpayers to that clinic. \nUse of “LITC” After Discontinuation of Services \nOnce an organization is no longer a grant recipient, the clinic must not use “LITC” as part of its name. \nCircular 230 prohibits practitioners from providing misleading or deceptive statements or claims. See \n31 CFR § 10.30(a)(1). If the organization will continue to exist but will not be receiving grant funds, it may be \nmisleading for the organization to call itself an LITC. Further, use of the LITC logo or LITC designation may \nlead to civil/criminal penalties or imprisonment. See 31 U.S.C. § 333. In appropriate circumstances, the LITC \nProgram Ofﬁce may need to refer the matter to the IRS’s Ofﬁce of Professional Responsibility and/or the Treasury \nInspector General for Tax Administration. \nPaperwork Reduction Act Notice \nThis application package and guidance document is provided for awards under the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic \nGrant Program. The information is requested from the applicants to determine their eligibility for an LITC grant \nand evaluate their grant proposals. Information is also requested from all grant recipients for progress monitoring \npurposes.

The Program Ofﬁce uses the information reported on \nthis form to correspond with clinics and to publicize the location of clinics to taxpayers in IRS publications and \nonline. Please follow the instructions carefully and report all information completely and accurately. A complete \nresponse means an entry must be provided for each ﬁeld. \nAll organizations submitting a Full Grant Application and NCC Request must complete this form. See  \nPublication 3319, Section IV, Application and Submission Process.  \nSpecific Instructions \nGrant Period Request \nCheck the appropriate box to indicate whether a single year or multiyear grant is requested. Under IRC § 7526, \nthe LITC Program Ofﬁce is authorized to issue grants for a period of up to three years. Generally, applicants that \nhave never been awarded an LITC grant are not eligible for a multiyear grant and may only request a single year \ngrant. \nEnter the total amount, rounded to whole dollars, of funding requested for the grant year. The maximum funding \nthat may be awarded is $200,000. \nNOTE:  President Biden’s 2025 budget request includes a $200,000 per award funding cap, so the LITC Program \nOffice is allowing applicants to request up to $200,000 for 2025. If Congress does not enact the increased funding \ncap, the Program Office will adjust each award accordingly to reflect any limitations in effect at that time. \nApplicant Information \nEnter the contact information for the organization applying for the grant. The name of the applicant must match \nexactly the name used to register on SAM.gov. If a grant is awarded, the award will be payable to the organization \nlisted in this section. \nFor Applicant’s Mailing Address, please provide a complete response, including zip plus-four code. Phone \nnumbers should be formatted as 123-456-7890 x.111. \nClinic Information \nThis section is used to report information about the clinic where services are provided to taxpayers. If a grant is \nawarded, the information entered in this section will be used exactly as entered to prepare IRS Publication 4134, \nLow Income Taxpayer Clinic List. Publication 4134 is the primary tool for many low-income and ESL taxpayers \nto locate LITC services. Thus, the clinic name as provided should be the name used in materials publicizing \nthe LITC’s services to taxpayers and the public. \nPlease provide a complete response, including zip plus-four code, for the Clinic Street Address, and Clinic Mailing \nAddress. Do not write “same.” Phone numbers should be formatted as 123-456-7890 x.111. When providing \nthe clinic’s website address, please provide the direct link to the LITC page if one is available. If no website exists, \nwrite “none.” \n104 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \nPlease individually list all languages in addition to English in which services can be provided on site. If the clinic \nuses a telephone or internet based translation service, state “other languages through interpreter services.” \nAll applicants must identify a Clinic Director, Qualiﬁed Tax Expert (QTE), and Qualiﬁed Business Administrator \n(QBA) responsible for clinic operations and management of funds. For more information on these positions, see \nPublication 3319, Section VI.C.i, Standards for Operating a Low Income Taxpayer Clinic. For the Clinic Director \nand QTE, list any applicable licenses and certiﬁcations. \nNOTE: During the application amendment process which takes place after grant recipients are selected, all clinics \nwill be required to provide a statement certifying that the CD, QTE, and all qualified representatives working \nwith the clinic are not under suspension or disbarment from practice before the IRS and are in good standing with \nall relevant professional state licensing authorities and federal courts. The Office of Professional Responsibility’s \ndisciplinary look-up contains searchable information regarding censures of practitioners for Circular 230 \nmisconduct and suspensions and disbarments of individuals from practice before the IRS.  See Search for \nDisciplined Tax Professionals | Internal Revenue Service (irs.gov). \nTax Compliance Officer \nAll applicants must identify a TCO. See Publication 3319, Section III.C.iii, Compliance with Federal Tax \nand Nontax Requirements and Glossary for a discussion of who may be designated to fill this role. The TCO \nis the individual responsible for handling the organization’s federal tax matters. Applicants must also provide \ndocumentation (e.g., articles of incorporation or a Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of \nRepresentative, signed by the appropriate official) that shows how the individual on Form 13424 is properly \nauthorized to receive tax information to prevent the IRS from making an unauthorized disclosure. When \nproviding articles of incorporation, ensure it is the most recent version. When providing Form 2848, be sure of \nthe following: \nn all required fields are completed; \nn in section 3, the type(s) of tax are listed; (e.g., 940, 941, 1120, 1065, 990); \nn in section 3, both current and past tax years are listed (e.g., 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020); \nn in section 7, the form is signed by an officer of the corporation who is authorized under the articles of  \nincorporation to designate an individual to receive federal tax information for the entity; and  \nn in Part II, the form is signed by the person being authorized to receive the tax information. \nComplying with federal tax obligations is a requirement to receive an LITC grant, so it is imperative that the \ndesignated individual be knowledgeable and prepared to promptly address any federal tax issues of the applicant \nor the sponsoring organization. \nAn applicant must be in full compliance with its federal tax responsibilities (filing and payment) when applying \nfor an LITC grant and throughout the grant year. \n105 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nAPPENDIX A\nVII\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nAPPENDIX A\nGLOSSARY",

This form \nis used to provide a detailed explanation for each spending category in the proposed budget for the LITC grant, \nincluding how federal grant funds and matching funds will be spent during the grant period. All budgeted \namounts must be reasonable, necessary, and allocable to this grant. In preparing the budget, adhere to existing \nguidelines in 2 CFR Part 200, 2 CFR Part 1000, and Publication 3319, which explain how budgeted amounts \nshould be reported. See Publication 3319, 2 CFR § 200.306, and 2 CFR § 1000.306 for guidance on matching \nfunds. \nNOTE: \nn Each budget item does not require a dollar-for-dollar match, but the total matching funds must equal or \nexceed the total federal funds requested.

For many organizations, an employee is \nconsidered full-time if he or she works 40 hours a week (for other programs it might be a different \nnumber). For this example, we will assume full-time is 40 hours per week. In one year, a full-time \nemployee would work 40 hours multiplied by 52 weeks for a total of 2,080 hours. If the employee will \ndevote 2,080 hours to the LITC, his or her FTE will be 1.0 (2,080 LITC hours/2,080 total hours). \nIf the employee will work 1,560 hours on LITC activities, then the FTE will be .75 (1,560 LITC \nhours/2,080 total hours). \nAnnual leave, sick leave, compensatory time off, and other approved leave categories are considered \n“hours worked” for purposes of deﬁning full-time equivalent employment that is reported. \n2. Calculate the personnel expense for each staff member. \nFor full-time salaried employees, multiply the total salary by the FTE, as calculated above, to arrive at \nthe LITC share of the personnel expense. \nFor salaried part-time staff, calculate the percentage of the staff ’s time to be devoted to the LITC \n(LITC hours/total hours) and then multiply that percentage by the employee’s total salary. \nFor hourly employees, multiply the LITC hours to be worked by the hourly rate. \n3.

The determination of whether it is practical or reasonable to allocate expenses directly \nin proportion to use depends on several factors, including the size of the organization running the LITC, size and \nnumber of other functions the organization operates, and the amount of the expense. \nG. Construction \nThis category is not applicable to this grant. No expenses are allowed. \nH. Other Expenses \nThis expense category is used to report all other direct costs that will be incurred in operating the LITC program \nthat are not properly included in categories A through G. The value of volunteer in-kind services is included in \nthis category as matching funds. The explanation should identify: \nn The type of expense; \nn Whether the cost will be paid using federal or matching funds; and \nn The source of the matching funds. \nThe explanation must also disclose the rate or rates that will be used to value volunteer in-kind services and the \nnumber of volunteer hours that will be provided, categorized by the type of service or volunteer, as appropriate. \nSee Publication 3319, Section IV.E.iii, Meeting the Matching Funds Requirement, Determining the Value of Volunteer \nServices. \nI. Total Direct Charges \nThe total of the direct charges is the sum of lines A–H for each column. \nJ. Indirect Charges \nReport indirect costs not directly related to the LITC program but incurred as part of the general overhead and \nadministration of the sponsoring organization. Necessary and reasonable expenses that support LITC activities \nas well as functions of the organization should be allocated and charged as a direct cost of award funds if it is \npractical to separate the portion of the expense allocable to LITC activities. The determination of whether it is \npractical or reasonable to allocate expenses directly in proportion to use depends on several factors, including the \nsize of the organization operating the LITC, size and number of other functions the organization operates, and the \namount of the expense. The Uniform Guidance deﬁnes indirect costs as: \n[T]hose costs incurred for a common or joint purpose beneﬁtting more than one cost objective, and \nnot readily assignable to the cost objectives speciﬁcally beneﬁtted, without effort disproportionate to \nthe results achieved. (2 CFR § 200.1.) \nFor example, an organization has a $5,000 expense that supports LITC activities and two other programs the \norganization operates. Suppose the organization can spend an additional $100 in administrative costs to accurately \nallocate the $5,000 among the three programs in proportion to the beneﬁt each received. In that case, the \nallocation is reasonable and the organization should perform the allocation and charge the portion of the $5,000 \nthat is allocable to LITC activities as a direct cost. \n112 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nNow suppose the organization has a $5,000 expense that supports LITC activities and two other programs the \norganization operates, but to properly allocate the $5,000 among the three programs in proportion to the beneﬁt \neach received, it would cost the organization an additional $2,000 in administrative costs. In that case, direct \nallocation of the cost is not cost-effective, and the organization can choose to account for the $5,000 expense as \nan indirect cost. The organization then apportions the total indirect costs (i.e., the indirect cost pool) to each of \nthe beneﬁting programs using a method that is consistent, reasonable, auditable, and in accordance with generally \naccepted business practices. \nThe Uniform Guidance in section 200.414(b) recognizes that because of the diverse characteristics and accounting \npractices of nonproﬁt organizations, it is not possible to specify the types of cost that may be classiﬁed as indirect \ncosts in all situations. The purpose of the federal award is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from \nindirect costs, rather than the nature of the goods and services expensed. \nTypical indirect expenses may include: \nn Salaries and wages of administrative and support staff; \nn Related employee beneﬁts; \nn Facility occupancy costs (e.g., utilities, security, maintenance); \nn Ofﬁce supplies; and \nn Legal and auditing charges. \nOnce the organization has classiﬁed expenses as either direct or indirect, the organization must determine how \nto allocate the indirect costs amongst the programs that they beneﬁt, so that LITC funds do not subsidize the \nindirect costs of other programs or functions of the organization. To calculate the amount of federal funds \nallocable to indirect costs, the organization may use a negotiated indirect cost rate agreement (ICRA) approved by \nthe organization’s cognizant agency. If the organization has never obtained a negotiated indirect cost rate or if its \nICRA has expired, it may elect to apply the de minimis rate of 15 percent. Note that once elected, the 15 percent \nrate must be used consistently for all federal awards until the organization chooses to negotiate for a rate. \nMatching Funds \nComplete this section by providing a narrative that includes: \nn A list of all sources of matching funds; \nn The amount of matching funds broken down by source; and \nn The methodology used for any calculations. \nThe clinic must state explicitly that matching funds to be provided to the LITC program: \nn Will not be used as matching funds for any other federal program; and \nn Will not be funds received from any other federal grant unless speciﬁcally authorized by statute to be eligible \nas matching funds. \nAn employee of the grant recipient may not be treated as a volunteer for purposes of valuing in-kind services. \nFor example, suppose an LITC pays an employee an hourly wage to work at the LITC three days a week, and the \nemployee chooses to spend an additional two days each week volunteering at the LITC. In the example, the LITC \nmay charge the employee’s wages as an expenditure of federal or matching funds, but it cannot apply the value of \nthe two days spent volunteering as a contribution to help meet the matching fund requirement. \n113 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nAPPENDIX A\nVII\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nAPPENDIX A\nGLOSSARY",

    "text": "INDEX\n \n \nFULL-TIME EQUIVALENT CALCULATION \nThis is a further demonstration of determining FTE and also determining what is properly counted as matching \nfunds for purposes of the LITC grant. \nExample FTE Calculations \nABC Legal Services LITC computes a 1.0 FTE based on a 40-hour work week (2,080 hours per year). \nExample: Clinic Director/(QTE) – John Fordham, Esq. \nJohn works full-time at ABC Legal Services. He will spend 32 hours per week on LITC grant \nactivities, for an annual total of 1,664 hours, making John a 0.80 FTE (1,664/2,080) for purposes of \nthe LITC grant. John’s annual salary is $89,000. Since John’s time spent on LITC grant activities is \nequivalent to 0.80 FTE, he will receive $71,200 of his total salary ($89,000) for his work in the LITC. \nThis is calculated by multiplying his FTE annual salary of $89,000 by 0.80 for a total of $71,200 \n($89,000 x 0.80 = $71,200). John’s compensation is comprised of $70,000 of grant funds and $29,000 \noperating funds. From the $71,200 in compensation for work on LITC activities, $50,000 will be paid \nfrom LITC grant funds (federal funds), and $21,200 from operating funds. Thus, a maximum of $21,200 \nmay be classiﬁed as matching funds. \nExample: Paralegal – Alice Gonzaga \nAlice works part-time for ABC Legal Services, for a total of 1,040 hours. Annually she will spend a total \nof 900 hours on LITC grant activities, making Alice a 0.43 FTE (900/2,080) for purposes of the LITC \ngrant. Alice is paid $22 per hour. She receives total annual compensation of $22,880 (1,040 x $22); \n$19,800 (900 x $22) of which will be compensation for her work in the LITC. Alice’s compensation will \nbe comprised of $10,000 paid from LITC grant funds (federal funds), and $9,800 (matching funds) paid \nfrom XYZ Private Foundation funds. The remaining compensation of $3,000 is for non-LITC work and \ntherefore is not eligible match. \nExample: Intake – Ruth Washington \nRuth works full-time at ABC Legal Services. She will spend 18.4 hours per week on LITC grant activities, \nfor an annual total of 957 hours, making Ruth a 0.46 FTE (957/2,080) for purposes of the LITC grant. \nRuth is paid $15 per hour. She receives total annual compensation of $31,200 (2,080 x $15). Ruth’s \ncompensation will be comprised of $14,355 paid from LITC grant funds (federal funds), and $16,845 for \nnon-LITC work is paid from operating funds. None of Ruth’s compensation may be classiﬁed as matching \nfunds, because all of her time spent on LITC grant activities is compensated using LITC grant funds. \nExample: Receptionist – Debra Chapman \nDebra works full-time at ABC Legal Services. She provides administrative and clerical support to three \nprograms including the LITC program. Debra will spend one-third of her time on LITC activities, \nmaking her a one-third FTE for purposes of the LITC grant. Debra’s annual salary is $30,000, so $10,000 \n(1/3 x $30,000) of her annual salary is allocable to LITC activities. The $10,000 allocable portion \nwill be paid using $6,000 from LITC grant funds (federal funds), and $4,000 paid from private cash \ncontributions. Thus, a maximum of $4,000 may be classiﬁed as matching funds. \n114 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nI\nm\na\nge of Form 13\n424-J (May \n2018).

Data from all clinics is totaled to provide program-wide statistical \ninformation about services provided to low-income and ESL taxpayers. Please be careful to follow the instructions \nfor this form and to report all information completely and accurately. If additional room is necessary to provide \ndetails about the activities reported on this form, include such details on Form 13424-N, Low Income Taxpayer \nClinic (LITC) Program Narrative, where appropriate. \nSpecific Instructions for Completing the Form \nOutreach Activities \nThe system will navigate to the screen below when the Form 13424-A is selected on the Form Selection screen. \nReport all outreach activities conducted during the reporting period in this section. Screenshot of Form 13424-A. Low Income Clinic (LITC) General Information Report section 1. \nOutreach activities are efforts designed to publicize the clinic and its services. Outreach activities may involve \ndirect communication with taxpayers or may be accomplished indirectly through other organizations or groups \nthat assist low-income or ESL taxpayers. Examples of outreach activities include a presentation about clinic \nservices made to taxpayers, a campaign to distribute clinic flyers or other marketing materials to local social \nservices organizations, or a table staffed at a community event such as a fair, forum, or meeting to inform the \npublic about clinic services. \nLITCs are encouraged to identify particular linguistic populations, geographic service areas, or other segments of \nthe low-income and ESL taxpayer community in which to focus outreach efforts. \nDetermine whether to record an outreach activity on line 1A, 1B, or 1C by looking to the primary intended \naudience of the activity, rather than the actual attendees. Outreach activities primarily intended to reach ESL \ntaxpayers should be reported on line 1A, activities primarily intended to reach non-ESL taxpayers in general \n134 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\n \n \n \n \nshould be reported on line 1B, and those intended for other organizations that assist ESL or low-income taxpayers \nshould be reported on line 1C. Report each outreach activity only once on line 1A, 1B, or 1C. \nA single outreach activity may span multiple days. For example, if a clinic staffs a booth for multiple days at a \nweeklong event, that should be counted as one outreach activity. Additional details about the extent of such efforts \ncan be included in the Program Narrative. A campaign that involves sending the same or similar letters to multiple \nrecipients should be counted as a single outreach activity. \ni. Line 1A. Report on this line the number of outreach activities conducted for ESL taxpayers; \nii.  Line 1B. Report on this line the number of outreach activities conducted for non-ESL taxpayers; \niii.  Line 1C. Report on this line the number of outreach activities conducted for other organizations that \nassist ESL or low-income taxpayers. For example, the clinic meets with board members of a local church \nin preparation for the church’s upcoming clothing drive to beneﬁt the homeless. The clinic requests that \nthe church inform low-income and ESL taxpayers about the clinic’s services. The clinic would record those \nefforts as a single outreach activity on line 1C; and \niv.  Line 1D. The amount on this line is the total number of outreach activities conducted during the \nreporting period. The system will total the sums of lines 1A, 1B, and 1C automatically. A description of the \nactivities must be included on Form 13424-N, LITC Program Narrative Report, line 2.iv. See Publication \n3319 for additional information. \nEducational Activities \nReport all educational activities conducted during the reporting period in this section. \nEducational activities are programs designed to inform ESL or low-income taxpayers about their rights and \nresponsibilities as taxpayers, as well as tax issues of particular signiﬁcance to the intended audience. Educational \nactivities may also be conducted for other organizations that assist low-income or ESL taxpayers. \nTo be considered an educational activity, information about a speciﬁc tax topic or topics must be conveyed \nto the audience. Examples of educational activities include a presentation about tax collection issues made to \nESL taxpayers, a workshop for low-income workers about how to properly complete a Form W-4, Employee’s \nWithholding Certificate, or the distribution of written materials about EITC eligibility rules to community case \nworkers of a social services organization for them to share with their clients. \nClinics may also use virtual platforms to deliver educational programs and may count them as educational \nactivities for the purposes of LITC reporting when there is a way for participants to be counted and for the \nspeaker and participants to interact. \nDetermine whether to record an educational activity on line 2A, 2B, or 2C by looking to the primary intended \naudience of the activity, rather than the actual attendees. Educational activities primarily intended to reach ESL \ntaxpayers should be reported on line 2A, activities primarily intended to reach non-ESL taxpayers should be \nreported on line 2B, and those intended for other organizations that assist ESL or low-income taxpayers should \nbe reported on line 2C. Report each educational activity only once on line 2A, 2B, or 2C.

The issues reported should relate to all cases reported on Form 13424-K, LITC Case \nInformation Report, line 1C. The Program Ofﬁce uses the information reported on this form and the other \nreporting forms to determine the scope of services provided by clinics. Data from all clinics is totaled to provide \nprogram-wide statistical information about services provided to low-income and ESL taxpayers. Be careful to \nfollow the instructions for this form and to report all information completely and accurately. \nSpecific Instructions for Completing the Form \nA case arises from a controversy between an individual and the IRS concerning the determination, collection, or \nrefund of any tax, penalties, additions to tax, or interest and includes any proceeding brought by the taxpayer \nunder Title 26. A controversy includes a dispute related to the tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act. A \ncontroversy does not include a federal criminal tax matter but may include certain civil actions arising under the \nInternal Revenue Code (IRC), for example those arising under IRC §§ 7431–7435. \nA case may involve more than one issue. An issue is counted only if the clinic undertakes representation on behalf \nof the taxpayer, the issue is disputed between the taxpayer and the IRS, and the clinic takes steps to resolve the \ndispute. An issue is counted and reported on this form only once for each case, regardless of the number of tax \nyears involved in the dispute. See Example 2 below. An issue is not counted on this form when the clinic only \ndiscusses the issue with the taxpayer and provides advice but does not take steps to advocate on behalf of the \ntaxpayer to the IRS or a court. See Example 3 below. \nExample 1: Reporting Case Issues \nClinic A represented ten taxpayers in EITC examination cases during the reporting period. Each case has \nfour issues in dispute: head of household ﬁling status, dependency exemptions, child tax credit, and EITC \neligibility. Clinic A would enter 10 on lines 30, 31, 37, and 38. \nExample 2: Reporting Case Issues \nClinic B represented a taxpayer in a collection case involving six tax years. Clinic B advocated for the \ntaxpayer’s accounts to be placed in currently not collectible status. Clinic B would count this case as one \ncurrently not collectible issue on line 60, regardless of the number of tax years in dispute. (This case would \nbe included in the total on line 6 of Form 13424-K for cases having more than one tax year in dispute.) \nExample 3: Reporting Case Issues \nClinic C represented a taxpayer in a collection case that involved negotiating with the IRS to establish an \ninstallment agreement. In the course of the representation, Clinic C discussed with the taxpayer various \ncollection alternatives, including an Offer in Compromise (OIC). The installment agreement issue would \nbe counted as an issue and reported on line 58 because Clinic C negotiated the installment agreement \non behalf of the taxpayer. The OIC discussion would not be counted as an issue and reported on line 59 \nbecause Clinic C did not prepare or submit to the IRS an OIC on behalf of the taxpayer. \n141 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nAPPENDIX B\nVII\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nAPPENDIX B\nGLOSSARY",

A controversy \ndoes not include a federal criminal tax matter but may include certain civil actions arising under the Internal \nRevenue Code, for example those arising under IRC §§ 7431–7435. \nA case is counted and reported in inventory when a taxpayer retains the clinic to represent him or her in an \nadvocacy capacity before the IRS or a federal court and the clinic takes steps to begin the case, including \ndeveloping a plan for advocacy. Case information continues to be counted and reported on this form each period \nuntil the case is closed. \nNOTE: Matters involving fact-ﬁnding or advice only are not cases; these matters are counted and reported as \nconsultations on Form 13424-A, LITC General Information Report. \nIf a taxpayer’s case requires the clinic to advocate to more than one IRS function or court or involves more than \none tax year, it is still counted and reported as a single case on Form 13424-K. The clinic can capture the breadth \nof the work done in the case by including the case in the numbers reported on line 5 (cases involving matters \nworked in more than one IRS function or court) or line 6 (cases involving more than one tax year) of this form \nand by reporting all of the relevant tax issues on Form 13424-B, LITC Case Issues Report. Additional information \nmay also be included in the Program Narrative on Form 13424-N, LITC Program Narrative Report, line 2.ix. \n149 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nAPPENDIX B\nVII\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nAPPENDIX B\nGLOSSARY",

On May 15, Clinic \nA submitted correspondence to the IRS’s Correspondence Exam unit on behalf of the taxpayer. On \nAugust 1, the IRS issued a Notice of Deﬁciency. On November 20, Clinic A ﬁled a petition in the U.S. \nTax Court. On its Interim Report, Clinic A would report the case on line 2E because the case was being \naddressed in the Correspondence Exam Unit as of June 30. On its Year-end Report, Clinic A would \nreport the case on line 2U because the case was being addressed in the U.S. Tax Court as of December 31. \nExample 2: Reporting Case Work \nClinic B is representing a taxpayer in a dispute involving eligibility for EITC for two tax years. At the \nclose of the reporting period, one tax year is being addressed in the U.S. Tax Court and the other tax year \nis being addressed by the IRS in an audit reconsideration. The Clinic B may report the case on either line \n2I or 2U but may not report the case on both lines.

The clinic agrees to represent the taxpayer and contacts the Automated Collection \nSystem (ACS) to prove ﬁnancial hardship, request the levy be released, and have the taxpayer’s account \nplaced in currently not collectible status. The clinic later assists the taxpayer in submitting an OIC. Clinic \nA should include this case among the number reported on line 5 because the clinic worked the case in \nboth the ACS and OIC units. \nExample 2: Reporting Additional Case Details \nClinic B is representing a taxpayer in a dispute involving eligibility for the EITC for two tax years. At the \nclose of the reporting period, one tax year is being addressed in the U.S. Tax Court and the other tax year \nis being addressed by the IRS in an audit reconsideration.

This form is also used to report \na narrative explanation of how each expense amount was calculated and the sources and valuation of matching \nfunds. All expenses must be reasonable, necessary, and allocable to the LITC grant. See 2 CFR Part 200 for \nadditional guidance on costs and matching funds. \nNOTE: Grant expenditure amounts must also be reported on Standard Form 425 (described below). \nSpecific Instructions for Completing the Form \n* The instructions provided on page 165-169 cannot be revised without OMB approval.

Clinics that use the de minimis rate to charge indirect costs must charge costs consistently across federal \ngrants and may not double charge or inconsistently charge as both. \nFor example, if a clinic is part of a larger organization that has an indirect cost rate agreement and the rental cost \nof the facility in which the clinic operates is included in the negotiated rate, then the clinic may not include the \nfacilities cost under the Contractual Expense category. Similarly, if the clinic elects to use the de minimis rate to \ncharge indirect costs on all its federal awards, no facilities and administration costs may be charged as direct costs. \nConstruction \nThis section has been disabled.

The Year-end statement about returned funds should include the reason(s) why \ngrant funds were not expended or made available for redistribution to other grantees at interim and whether this \nwas due to a one-time occurrence or an ongoing issue. \nNOTE: A clinic must notify its assigned advocacy analyst when it identiﬁes that it will not spend all the grant \nfunds, and it is outside of the Interim and Year-end reporting submission times. Timely notiﬁcation is important \nbecause the Program Ofﬁce may be able to redistribute the unused funds to another clinic. \nFor the Interim Report only, if the LITC grant award is less than $200,000, a clinic may request additional LITC \ngrant funds for the current grant year (to be used before December 31). Select the Yes button and provide a \nstatement indicating the amount of additional funds requested, the expense category or categories where the funds \nwill be spent, and the amount and source of matching funds that will be provided if the additional funding is \nawarded.

This form is used to report \nnarrative explanations of the program plan, how the clinic meets the requirements of the grant, trends in the \ntypes of cases encountered, and success stories of note that occurred during the reporting period. This form \nalso provides an opportunity to supplement responses from other reporting forms included in the Interim and \nYear-end Report that relate to representation, education, and advocacy efforts. \nThis form is also used to report the steps taken to resolve open cases and provide ongoing representation, where \nappropriate, for clinics that will no longer be participating in the LITC grant program in the next grant period. \nThe Program Ofﬁce uses the information reported on this form and the other reporting forms to determine \nthe scope of services provided by clinics. Data from all clinics is totaled to provide program-wide statistical \ninformation about services provided to low-income and ESL taxpayers. \nSpecific Instructions for Completing the Form \nAll ﬁelds require an entry even if the response is N/A or Not Applicable. Each section has an 8,000 character \nlimit, except where designated. For purposes of reporting on Program Plan Progress (Section 1) and addressing \nGrant Requirements (Section 2), clinics should report activities performed between January 1 and June 30 on the \nInterim Report. The Year-end Report will cover work performed between January 1 and December 31 with the \nexception of Success Stories (Section 3) and Emerging Issues (Section 4), which should be answered from work \nperformed during the second half of the year only. However, if an emerging issue was included in the Interim \nReport, and continued through the second half of the year, it is appropriate to include it again in the Year-end \nReport, especially if the issue or trend increased in prevalence or new examples of it were identiﬁed. To the extent \nthat these instructions may conflict with the information included with the Form 13424-N ﬁllable form, please \nfollow the instructions provided here. \nProgram Plan Progress \nThe system will navigate to the screen below when the Form 13424-N is selected on the Form Selection screen. \nReport the progress made in implementing the program plan during the reporting period in this section.

See IRC § 7526(b)(1)(B)(i). The Director of OMB has not established a \npoverty level or criteria. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) publishes annual Federal Poverty \nGuidelines based on family unit size and geographic location, which are applicable to the LITC Program. For \n2024, the Federal Poverty Guidelines were published at 89 Fed. Reg. 2961-2963 (Jan.17, 2024). \nA \nAllowable Expenses – expenses chargeable to a grant as a use of federal funds or matching funds in accordance \nwith the cost principles guidance in 2 CFR Part 200 and 2 CFR Part 1000. Generally, for an expense to be \nallowable, the expense must: \nn Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the federal award and be allocable thereto under the \napplicable cost principles; \nn Conform with any limitations or exclusions set forth in the cost principles or in the Notice of Award; \nn Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally-ﬁnanced and other \nactivities of the grant recipient; \nn Be accorded consistent treatment by the grant recipient; \nn Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except for state \nand local governments and Indian tribes only, as otherwise provided for in the cost principles; \nn Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of any other federally-\nﬁnanced program in either the current or a prior period; \nn Be adequately documented; and \nn Be incurred during the approved budget period. However, the federal awarding agency is authorized, \nat its discretion, to waive prior written approvals to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent \nbudget periods pursuant to 2 CFR § 200.308(g)(3). \nApplication – a request for LITC grant funding submitted to the LITC Program Office. When used it is referring \nto either an LITC Full Grant Application or a Non-Competing Continuation (NCC) Request, depending upon \nthe type of application that the organization needs to complete. \nAppropriation – a law authorizing federal agencies to obligate funds and make payments from the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury for speciﬁed purposes. Appropriations are annual acts and permanent law. Until \nCongress makes an appropriation for the LITC Program, the LITC Program Ofﬁce may not be able to inform \ngrant recipients of the amount of their funding. \nAward – the provision of funds by the LITC Program Ofﬁce to an organization to carry out activities in support \nof the LITC mission. It is based on an approved application and budget and is subject to a federal appropriation. \n187 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nGLOSSARY\nVII\nAPPENDICES\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nGLOSSARY\nC \nB \nBasis of Accounting – the time at which ﬁnancial transactions are recorded. There are two primary methods for \ntracking income and expenses. With accrual basis accounting, income is recorded when earned and expenses are \nrecorded when incurred. With cash basis accounting, income is recorded when received and expenses are recorded \nwhen paid. \nBudget – a request for funds to support an activity, presented by expense category. An initial budget is submitted \nwith the application proposing how the applicant intends to use the funds. If an award is made, the clinic will \nsubmit a revised budget with the clinic’s application amendment that is due shortly after the award amount is \nfinalized and the Notice of Award is issued. \nCase Management System – a system that may be used by grant recipients to capture intake information, \ncalculate client ﬁnancial eligibility, track case status and outcomes, input case notes, maintain timekeeping \nrecords, record educational and outreach activities, and compile data for Interim and Year-end Reports. LITCs \nare strongly encouraged to use case management software to maintain and monitor client ﬁles. An LITC may \npurchase case management software with grant funds to efﬁciently track and report its program activities. \nCatalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) – a governmentwide compendium of federal programs and \nactivities that provide assistance or beneﬁts. See https://sam.gov/content/assistance-listings. The CFDA number \nfor the LITC Program is 21.008. \nClinic Director – a staff member who has overall management responsibility for the clinic. The Clinic Director \nmay also be the QTE or QBA, if qualiﬁed. The Clinic Director manages day-to-day clinic operations, prepares or \nreviews the required clinic reports, and signs reports as the clinic’s authorized representative. The Clinic Director \nserves as the primary contact person for both the LITC Program Ofﬁce and the Local Taxpayer Advocate (LTA) \nofﬁce. In most circumstances, the Clinic Director will have the role of Principal Investigator/Program Director \n(PI/PD) in GrantSolutions for purposes of signing and submitting forms. In some organizations, the PI/PD may \nbe the Executive Director. \nCloseout – the process by which the federal awarding agency determines that all applicable administrative \nactions and all required work of the federal award have been completed and takes actions as described in \n2 CFR § 200.344. \nCongressional District – an electoral constituency, apportioned by population, which elects a Member of Congress. \nContinuing Legal Education (CLE) – an accredited professional educational program for attorneys. CLE is \nalso known as MCLE (Mandatory or Minimum Continuing Legal Education). The number of CLE credit hours \nwill vary by program and is dependent upon state CLE board approval. CLE rules vary by jurisdiction. Some \njurisdictions may not allow CLE credit for all types of programs, such as teleconferences or webinars. \n188 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nContinuing Professional Education (CPE) – an accredited educational program required to maintain a \nprofessional license, such as a Certiﬁed Public Accountant or Enrolled Agent designation. \nD \nDemographics – vital or social statistics (e.g., income, education level, native spoken language) of a group or \npopulation of taxpayers within a deﬁned state, county, or geographic regional area. \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (The Data Act) – a law that requires the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury to establish common standards for ﬁnancial data provided by all government agencies \non the USASpending website to increase transparency in federal expenditures and to make the information more \naccessible to the public. Among other objectives, the Data Act also aims to simplify reporting for entities receiving \nfederal funds and improve the quality of submitted data. \nDirect Costs – costs that can be identiﬁed with or allocated speciﬁcally to a particular program, such as an LITC \nProgram, with a high degree of accuracy. Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be \ntreated consistently as either direct or indirect. For additional information, see 2 CFR § 200.413. \nDirect Lobbying – activities supporting the enactment, modiﬁcation, or adoption of any law, regulation, or \npolicy at any level of government. Direct lobbying includes influencing or attempting to influence a Member of \nCongress, a state or local legislator, or any of their staff members to take a position or action on a speciﬁc piece of \nlegislation or potential legislation. For additional information, see 2 CFR § 200.450. \nE \nEngagement Letter – an agreement that deﬁnes the speciﬁc matters for which the LITC will provide \nrepresentation and protects both the representative and the taxpayer by informing both parties as to the agreement \nof assigned responsibilities over the course of the professional relationship. Written copies of the engagement letter \nor retainer agreement signed by both the representative and the taxpayer should be retained by the LITC and a \ncopy should be retained by the taxpayer. \nF \nFamily Unit – for purposes of the 90/250 rule, a family unit is generally deﬁned as an unrelated individual or a \nfamily. An unrelated individual is a person 15 years old or over not living with persons related by birth, marriage, \nor adoption. A family is a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, civil union, or adoption who \nlive together. However, if related individuals live together, but the person seeking assistance from the LITC is \nﬁnancially independent, then that person may be treated as a family unit, distinct from relatives in the household. \nIf two unrelated individuals live together, they constitute two family units. \nFederal Register – an ofﬁcial daily publication that provides a uniform system for communicating proposed and \nﬁnal regulations and legal notices issued by federal agencies, including announcements of the availability of funds \nfor ﬁnancial assistance programs. \n189 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nGLOSSARY\nVII\nAPPENDICES\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nGLOSSARY\n \nFringe Benefits – allowances and services provided by employers to their employees as compensation in addition \nto regular salaries and wages. Fringe beneﬁts include, but are not limited to, the costs of leave (vacation, family-\nrelated, sick, or military), employee insurance, pensions, and unemployment beneﬁt plans. For additional \ninformation, see 2 CFR § 200.431. \nG \nGrant – a ﬁnancial assistance mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an \napproved project or activity. \nI \nIndirect Costs – costs that have been incurred for common or joint objectives with other grant programs and \ncannot be readily identiﬁed with the LITC Program. After direct costs have been determined and assigned directly \nwhere appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to a particular program. Direct cost of minor \namounts may be treated as indirect costs under the conditions described in 2 CFR § 200.413(d). A cost may \nnot be allocated to the LITC Program as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like \ncircumstances, has been assigned to another federal award as a direct cost. Indirect costs may be charged as a use of \nfederal funds based upon an approved Indirect Cost Rate Agreement or the de minimis rate of 15 percent allowed \nunder 2 CFR § 200.414. Indirect costs are not allowable as matching funds. \nIntake – a process used by clinic staff to gather information from a taxpayer seeking assistance to determine \neligibility for services. LITCs must record the taxpayer’s income information on an intake form (paper or \nelectronic). If the taxpayer is part of a family unit, the income of the family unit should be reported and utilized in \nthe eligibility determination. LITCs must also determine and document the amount in controversy during intake. \nIndividual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) – a unique nine-digit number used for tax administration \npurposes that the IRS issues to individuals who are not eligible to obtain a Social Security number (SSN). \nL \nLocal Taxpayer Advocate (LTA) – a delegate of the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA) who is a manager in a \nlocal jurisdiction and reports to the NTA. IRC § 7803(c)(2)(D)(i)(I) requires that each state have at least one LTA \nwho is independent of the local IRS ofﬁce. Each LTA provides essential guidance and assistance to the LITCs \nwithin his or her geographic area or as assigned by the LTA’s manager. \nLimited Entry of Appearance – to improve efficiency and to encourage the assistance of unrepresented taxpayers, \nthe U.S. Tax Court has allowed practitioners to enter Limited Entry of Appearance. See Tax Court Rule 24, \nlimited representation means that the legal services provided are limited in scope and duration to less than full \nrepresentation. \n190 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nM \nMatching Funds – the portion of program costs not funded by federal funds. Grant recipients must \nprovide matching funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis for all LITC grant funds received. See IRC § 7526(c)(5), \n2 CFR § 200.1, and § 200.306 for more information. Only funds that are used in direct support of the LITC \nProgram qualify as matching funds. Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements \nfor Federal Awards, 2 CFR § 200.306 (and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s implementation thereof at \n2 CFR § 1000.306) provides that all contributions, including cash and third-party in-kind, shall be accepted as \npart of the grant recipient’s cost sharing or matching when such contributions: \nn Are veriﬁable from the grant recipient’s records; \nn Are not included as contributions for any other federally assisted project or program; \nn Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efﬁcient accomplishment of project or program objectives; \nn Are allowable under the applicable cost principles; \nn Are not paid by the federal government under another award, except where authorized by the federal \nstatute to be used for cost sharing or matching; \nn Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the federal awarding agency; and \nn Conform to other provisions of 2 CFR Part 200, when applicable. \nN \nNational Taxpayer Advocate (NTA) – the ofﬁcial who supervises and directs the Ofﬁce of the Taxpayer Advocate. \nThe NTA reports directly to the IRS Commissioner and serves as the voice of the taxpayer with the IRS and \nbefore Congress. Final LITC grant funding decisions are made by the NTA, unless recused. In recusal situations, \nﬁnal funding decisions are made by the Deputy National Taxpayer Advocate. \nNon-Competing Continuation (NCC) Request – a request for LITC grant funding submitted to the LITC \nProgram Ofﬁce through GrantSolutions and using the speciﬁed forms in accordance with LITC Program Ofﬁce \ninstructions. NCC Requests must be submitted in lieu of a Full Grant Application by organizations already \nfunded with a multiyear LITC grant. \nO \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) – the White House ofﬁce that oversees the preparation of the federal \nbudget and supervises its administration in Executive Branch agencies. OMB evaluates the effectiveness of agency \nprograms, policies, and procedures, assesses competing funding demands among agencies, and sets funding \npriorities. OMB ensures that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the \nPresident’s Budget and with Administration policies. \nOMB Guidance – comprehensive principles issued by OMB that provide guidance relating to the administration \nof federal grant awards. Grant award administrative requirements are set forth in the Uniform Administrative \nRequirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 CFR Part 200 (and U.S. Department \n191 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nGLOSSARY\nVII\nAPPENDICES\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nGLOSSARY\nof the Treasury has implemented those requirements at 2 CFR Part 1000). The Uniform Guidance helps ensure \nthe highest integrity in the ﬁnancial management and operation of federal grant programs and strengthens \naccountability for federal funds by improving policies that protect against waste, fraud, and abuse. In addition, the \nguidance aims to minimize the time applicants and grant recipients must spend complying with administrative \nrequirements. \nOperational Review Visit – a site assistance visit conducted by LITC Program Ofﬁce staff to evaluate a clinic’s \noverall operations and to provide technical assistance to help the grant recipient maintain compliance with the \nterms and conditions of the LITC grant. During an operational review visit, an LITC Advocacy Analyst will \ninterview clinic personnel, examine intake procedures, review case management and reporting systems, and \nsample ﬁnancial records. An operational review visit may also include observation of clinic facilities and review \nof procedures and internal controls, personnel policies, training plans, privacy and conﬁdentiality policies, \noutreach plans and materials, educational curricula, fee policies, and client satisfaction instruments. When \nmonitoring and evaluating clinic activities, the LITC Program Ofﬁce will respect the clinic’s duty to protect \nconﬁdential information and will not interfere with the conﬁdential nature of the relationship between qualiﬁed \nrepresentatives and their clients. The LITC Program Ofﬁce strives to conduct an operational review visit to each \nclinic at least once every three years. However, the LITC Program Ofﬁce may conduct an operational review visit \nat any time. \nOrientation Visit – a site assistance visit conducted by LITC Program Ofﬁce staff to a grant recipient that did not \nreceive a grant in the previous year. An orientation visit generally occurs during the ﬁrst 120 days of the grant year. \nAn orientation visit provides an opportunity to familiarize a new grant recipient with LITC Program requirements \nand to measure the progress of its start-up activities. Speciﬁcally, an orientation visit allows the LITC Program \nOfﬁce to assess the status of newly funded clinics and to identify potential areas where the grant recipient may \nneed to create systems or improve processes to meet the requirements of the LITC Program. \nP \nPayment Management System (PMS) – an electronic system maintained by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services that is used to pay federal funds. New grant recipients must create an account with PMS and \nobtain a username and password to use the system. PMS allows a grant recipient to make an online request for \npayment of federal funds. After a request is processed and approved, funds are directly deposited into the grant \nrecipient’s bank account through a process called Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Funds are generally available \nwithin one business day of the request. PMS is also utilized by grant recipients to submit required Federal Cash \nTransaction Reports. Failure to timely submit the required reports may lead to PMS freezing access to grant funds. \nQ \nQualified Business Administrator (QBA) – a staff member with sufﬁcient business administration expertise \nto oversee the clinic’s business operations. The QBA must demonstrate education or experience with business \nor program administration, such as internal controls, grant funds management, budgeting, procurement, or the \nequivalent. If a department, as opposed to a single individual, fulﬁlls this requirement, please provide details in the \ngrant application about the staff member who oversees the department. \n192 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nQualified Tax Expert (QTE) – generally, a staff member of the clinic (or a volunteer in the case of the ESL \nEducation Pilot Program) with sufﬁcient tax law expertise to oversee technical substantive and procedural tax \nmatters. The QTE must be a qualiﬁed representative. The QTE is also responsible for reviewing all educational \nmaterials for accuracy before distribution. \nR \nRepresentation – acting as an agent of the taxpayer in an advocacy capacity in a matter before the IRS, the U.S. \nTax Court, or another federal court, or before a state or local tax authority when the clinic is representing the \ntaxpayer in a related federal tax controversy. Fact ﬁnding or advice alone does not constitute representation. \nS \nSpecial Appearance Authorization – a letter issued by the Director of the LITC Program Ofﬁce that authorizes \nstudents and law graduates working at an LITC or Student Tax Clinic Program to represent taxpayers before the \nIRS. Practice under a special appearance authorization is limited to students and law graduates at an LITC or \nStudent Tax Clinic Program working under the direct supervision of an individual authorized to practice before \nthe IRS. For additional information, see Section VI.C.xii, Representing Low-Income Taxpayers. \nStandards of Operation – baseline operational requirements developed by the LITC Program Ofﬁce and \napplicable to all clinics to ensure that all programs provide consistent and quality service to low-income and \nEnglish as a second language (ESL) taxpayers. \nSupport Staff – a group of people within an organization who perform such activities as answering the phone, \nscheduling appointments, copying materials, maintaining information on employees or volunteers, and \nmaintaining timekeeping records. \nSystemic Advocacy – identifying and advocating for issues that impact low-income and ESL taxpayers utilizing a \nvariety of methods, including but not limited to: \nn Participating in advocacy projects with professional organizations; \nn Commenting on proposed IRS regulations and guidance; \nn Preparing and ﬁling an amicus brief to alert a court about the concerns of low-income or ESL taxpayers; \nn Authoring articles in scholarly journals or general interest publications; \nn Appearing on television or radio to raise awareness about tax issues that affect low-income or ESL \ntaxpayers; \nn Producing public service announcements; or \nn Submitting issues to the Systemic Advocacy Management System (SAMS), available through the IRS \nwebsite at www.irs.gov/advocate/systemic-advocacy-management-system-sams. \n193 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nGLOSSARY\nVII\nAPPENDICES\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nGLOSSARY\n \nT \nTax Compliance Officer (TCO) – an authorized individual responsible for handling the organization’s federal \ntax matters and with whom the LITC Program Ofﬁce can address any issues identiﬁed during federal tax \ncompliance reviews of applicants and grant recipients. If the applicant is part of a larger organization (e.g., \nacademic institution which operates a clinic), the LITC Program Ofﬁce must be able to verify that the sponsoring \norganization does not have a federal tax compliance issue before awarding grant funds. Applicants must also \nprovide documentation (e.g., articles of incorporation or a Form 2848) that shows the individual identified as \nthe TCO on Form 13424 is properly authorized to receive tax information to prevent the IRS from making an \nunauthorized disclosure. \nTax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) – an IRS initiative designed to promote and support free tax counseling \nand basic income tax return preparation for individuals aged 60 years or over who cannot afford professional \nassistance. Cooperative grant agreements are entered into between the IRS and eligible organizations to provide \nthe free tax return preparation assistance. \nTax Return Preparation – an LITC can provide assistance with a federal tax return, a claim for refund, or an \nITIN application if such assistance is necessary to resolve a controversy with the IRS or limited preparation may \nbe done when ancillary to an LITC’s ESL education program. \nTechnical Assistance Consultation – a discussion with a practitioner or other service provider designed to give \nbrief advice about a tax issue. \nThird Party In-Kind Contributions – the value of non-cash contributions provided as matching funds by parties \nother than the grant recipient or federal government. Third party in-kind contributions may be in the form of \ngoods, office space, or services donated to the LITC. \nU \nUnallowable Expenses – expenses for which LITC grant funds may not be used according to restrictions \npublished by OMB, the LITC Program Ofﬁce, appropriations language, or conditions outlined in the grant \nrecipient’s Notice of Award. \nUnderserved Area – an identiﬁable geographic area where the need for LITC services exceeds the capacity \navailable from current grant recipients. \nUnique Entity Identifier (UEI) – the official identifier for doing business with the government and is assigned \nand managed through the System for Award Management (SAM.gov). The UEI replaced the Data Universal \nNumbering System (DUNS) number. \nUnused Funds – the portion of grant funds awarded to clinics that has not been spent, whether or not those \nfunds have been drawn down from PMS. If a grant recipient determines that it will not spend its entire award, the \ngrant recipient should immediately notify the LITC Program Ofﬁce. \n194 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nV \nVolunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) – an IRS initiative designed to promote and support free tax return \npreparation service for the underserved through various community partner organizations. This service helps \nlow- to moderate-income individuals, persons with disabilities, the elderly, and limited English speakers ﬁle their \ntax return each year. The IRS awards matching funds to these support organizations that offer free tax return \npreparation services during the tax ﬁling season at locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. \n195 \nLOW INCOME TAXPAYER CLINICS\nVII\nAPPENDICES\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI",
