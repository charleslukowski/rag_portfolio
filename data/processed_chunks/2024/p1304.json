    "text": "Introduction \nThis report contains complete individual income tax data for \nTax Year (TY) 2022. The statistics are based on a stratified \nprobability sample of individual income tax returns, selected \nbefore audit, which represents a population of 161.3 million \nU.S. Individual Income Tax Returns (Forms 1040 and 1040-\nSR), including electronic returns, filed for TY 2022. \nTable A presents selected income and tax items for TYs \n2018 through 2022 as they appear on the forms and provides \nthe percentage change between 2021 and 2022 for each item. \nWhen comparing income and tax items for different years, it \nis important to consider any tax law changes that affect the \ndata. The tax law changes are explained later in this section. \nTo assist with year-to-year comparisons, Table A includes the \nitems in current dollars and constant 1990 dollars, as adjusted \nby the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index for \nAll Urban Consumers. \nFor TY 2022, the number of individual income tax re-\nturns filed rose by 0.5 million, or 0.3%. Adjusted gross income \n(AGI) rose 0.3% from 2021 to 2022. This increase in AGI \nwas reflected by increases in some components of income that \nincluded: taxable interest (29.0%); salaries and wages (7.9%); \ntaxable income from Individual Retirement Arrangement \n(IRA) distributions (7.2%); ordinary dividends (6.6%); and \ntaxable income from pensions and annuities (6.3%). Two \nsignificant components of AGI that showed decreases were \nnet capital gains (38.9%) and business or profession net income \nless loss (0.3%). Taxable income decreased by 0.5% to $11.7 \ntrillion for 2022. Similarly, income tax after credits decreased \nby 5.1% to $2.1 trillion, and the total tax liability decreased by \n5.4% to $2.3 trillion. \nThis report is divided into nine sections. The remainder of \nthis section (Section 1) explains the requirements for filing and \nchanges in the law for 2022. Section 2 offers a brief analysis \nof the data, and Section 3 discusses tax rates and computation \nof total income tax. Section 4 discusses tax shares of AGI and \ntotal income tax and is followed by tables of detailed aggre-\ngate statistics on individual tax returns (Section 5). Section 6 \nprovides explanations of the terms used in the tables. Section \n7 describes the sample of individual income tax returns upon \nwhich the statistics are based. Key individual income tax \nforms appear in Section 8, and the report ends with a subject",

Gross income comprised all income received in \nthe form of money, goods, property, and services that was not \nexpressly exempt from tax, including any income from sources \noutside the United States or from the sale of a taxpayer’s main \nhome (even if the taxpayer could have excluded part or all of \nit). Generally, a citizen or resident of the United States was \nrequired to file a tax return if gross income for the year was at \nleast as much as the amount shown for the appropriate filing \nstatus in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the filing requirements for \ntaxpayers who could be claimed as a dependent by another \nperson (such as a parent). \nIn addition to the general filing requirements, an indi-\nvidual was obligated to file a return for TY 2022 if the person \ndid any of the following for TY 2022: \n1.  Was liable for any of the following taxes: \na.  Alternative minimum tax (AMT); \nb.  Additional tax on a qualified plan, including an \nIRA or other tax-favored account (unless only filing \nbecause the taxpayer owed this tax; then the taxpayer \ncould have filed only Form 5329, Additional Taxes \non Qualified Plans (including IRAs) and Other Tax-\nFavored Accounts); \nc.  Household employment taxes (unless only filing \nbecause the taxpayer owed this tax; then the tax-\npayer could have filed only Schedule H, Household \nEmployment Taxes); \nd.  Social Security or Medicare tax on unreported tip \nincome; \ne.  Uncollected Social Security, Medicare, or Railroad \nRetirement tax on reported tip income or group-term \nlife insurance and additional taxes on health savings \naccounts (HSAs); or \nf.  Tax from the recapture of various credits, including \ninvestment credits, low-income housing credits, or \nthe first-time homebuyer credit. \n2.

The income levels at \nwhich the AMT exemption began to phase out increased to \n$539,900 from $523,600 ($1,079,800 from $1,047,200 if mar-\nried filing jointly or a qualifying surviving spouse). Also, for \n2022, the 26% tax rate applied to the first $206,100 ($103,050 \nif married filing separately) of alternative minimum taxable \nincome. Previously it applied to the first $199,900 ($99,950) \nof such income. \nChild and dependent care credit—The changes imple-\nmented by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted \non March 11, 2021, were not extended. For 2022, the dollar \nlimit on qualifying expenses was $3,000 (previously $8,000 \nin 2021) for one qualifying person and $6,000 (previously \n$16,000) for two or more qualifying persons. The percentage \nof qualifying expenses eligible for the credit was decreased \nfrom 50% to 35%, along with the income limit at which the \ncredit began phasing out, $15,000 (previously $125,000 for \n2021). Additionally, for taxpayers who received dependent \ncare benefits from their employer, the dollar limit of the ex-\nclusion amount decreased for 2022 to $5,000 (previously \n$10,500). For married employees filing separate returns, the \nmaximum amount decreased to $2,500 (previously $5,250). \nAlso, for 2022 this credit was nonrefundable whereas it was a \nrefundable credit for 2021. \nChild tax credit—Under the American Rescue Plan Act \nof 2021, many changes were made to enhance the child tax \ncredit, however those changes were not extended for 2022. A \nchild must have been under age 17 at the end of 2022 to be a \nqualifying child, down from 18 in 2021. Depending on modi-\nfied AGI, a taxpayer received a credit amount of up to $2,000 \nfor a qualifying child down from $3,600 for children under 5 \nand $3,000 for those older. The amount of the child tax credit \nthat could be claimed as a refundable credit was limited as it \nwas in 2020, except the maximum additional child tax credit \namount was increased to $1,500 for each qualifying child. The \ncredit for other dependents remained at $500 and was figured \nas it was in 2021. \nEarned income credit—The maximum amount of the EIC \nincreased for taxpayers with at least one qualifying child, as \ndid the amounts of earned income and investment income an \nindividual could receive and still claim the credit. The maxi-\nmum credit for taxpayers with no qualifying children fell from \n$1,502 to $560. For these taxpayers, earned income and AGI \nhad to be less than $16,480 ($22,610 if married filing jointly) \nto be eligible for the EIC. Special rules applied if claiming \nthe EIC without a qualifying child in 2021 but did not apply \nto 2022. For 2022, a taxpayer could claim the EIC without \na qualifying child if they were at least age 25 (up from 19 \nin 2021) but under age 65 (with no upper age limit in 2021). \nFor taxpayers with one qualifying child, the maximum credit \nincreased from $3,618 to $3,733, and, for taxpayers with two \nqualifying children, the maximum credit increased from \n$5,980 to $6,164. To be eligible for the credit, a taxpayer’s \nearned income and AGI had to be less than $43,492 ($49,622 \nfor married filing jointly) for one qualifying child, or less than \n$49,399 ($55,529 for married filing jointly) for two qualify-\ning children. The maximum credit for taxpayers with three or \nmore qualifying children increased from $6,728 to $6,935. For \nthese taxpayers, earned income and AGI had to be less than \n$53,057 ($59,187 if married filing jointly) to be eligible for the \nEIC. The maximum amount of investment income (interest, \ndividends, and capital gain income) a taxpayer could have and \nstill claim the credit was $10,300 for the year. If a taxpayer \nwas married but didn’t file a joint return, they may still have \nqualified to claim the EIC if they lived with a qualifying child \nfor more than half the year and lived apart from their spouse \nfor the last 6 months of 2022 or were legally separated under \nwritten agreement and did not live in the same household as \ntheir spouse. If two taxpayers could claim the same qualify-\ning child, the taxpayer who did not claim the child was able to \nclaim the EIC without a qualifying child. \nHealth coverage tax credit—The health coverage tax \ncredit was not available after 2021. \nQualified sick and family leave credit—The American \nRescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted on March 11, 2021, pro-\nvided certain self-employed individuals the opportunity to \nclaim credits for up to 10 days of “paid sick leave,” and up to \n60 days of “paid family leave,” if they were unable to work or \ntelework due to circumstances related to COVID-19. For 2022, \nthese credits could not be claimed by self-employed taxpayers. \nStandard deduction amount—The standard deduction \nfor people who did not itemize deductions on Schedule A of \nForm 1040 was increased in 2022 for all filers. This amount \ndepended on the taxpayer’s filing status, whether the taxpayer \nwas age 65 or older, or whether the taxpayer was a dependent \nof another person. For 2022, the standard deduction increased \nto $25,900 for joint filers, up from $25,100 for 2021. For single \nfilers and married filers filing separately, the deduction amount \nincreased to $12,950, up from $12,550. For heads of house-\nholds, the deduction was $19,400, up from $18,800. \n22 \n23",

    "text": "Section 2  \nIndividual Income   \nTax Returns, 2022  \nT\naxpayers filed 161.3 million individual income tax \nreturns for Tax Year (TY) 2022, an increase of 0.3% \nfrom the 160.8 million returns filed for TY 2021. Total \nincome reported on these returns totaled $15.0 trillion, a 0.3% \nincrease from the previous year. Total wages, the largest com-\nponent of total income (65.0% in 2022), rose 7.9% from 2021 \nto $9.7 trillion. Statutory adjustments, which are subtracted \nfrom total income to arrive at adjusted gross income (AGI), in-\ncreased 1.8% to $143.7 billion. AGI rose 0.3% to $14.8 trillion \nfor the year. Total income tax fell 2.6% to $2.1 trillion. After \nrefundable portions of refundable credits and the portions that \noffset all other taxes from total income tax were subtracted, \ntotal income tax was $2.0 trillion, and the average tax rate for \nthis concept declined from 13.8% in 2021 to 13.7% for 2022. \nTotal Income \nTotal income increased 0.3% to $15.0 trillion for 2022 (Figure \nA). Total wages, the largest component of total income, in-\ncreased 7.9%, to $9.7 trillion. Within total income, the share \nof total wages increased to 65.0% for 2022, up from 60.4% for \n2021. Another large component of total income in 2022, net \ncapital gains (less loss), showed a major decrease of 38.9% to \n$1.2 trillion. Capital gain distributions, a component of net \ncapital gains, showed a large decrease of 49.6% from the previ-\nous year. Taxpayers reported capital gain distributions either \non Schedule D with other sales of capital assets or alone on \nForm 1040. Partnership and S corporation net income (less \nloss), another large component of total income, in contrast, \nincreased 5.7% from 2021. Unemployment compensation \nshowed a decrease of 85.5% for 2022. Unemployment compen-\nsation was claimed on 4.7 million returns (a 70.1% decrease) \nfor $30.2 billion in 2022. Another component of income that \nshowed a large increase was taxable interest, up 29.0%. \nRetirement income items all showed increases from \n2021. Taxable Social Security benefits grew by 11.1%, taxable \nIndividual Retirement Account distributions were up 7.2%, \nand taxable pensions and annuities increased 6.3%. \nStatutory Adjustments \nStatutory adjustments increased 1.8% to $143.7 billion for \n2022 (Figure B). The three largest adjustments were all related \nto self-employment (deductible part of self-employment tax, \nself-employed health insurance, and payments to a self-em-\nployed retirement plan). These three items together increased \n3.3% and accounted for 70.7% of total statutory adjustments. \nTaxpayers subtracted these adjustments from total income \nwhen computing AGI. For 2022, taxpayers filed 161.3 mil-\nlion tax returns with a reported AGI of $14.8 trillion, a 0.3% \nincrease from the previous year. \nDeductions \nTotal deductions, the sum of standard deductions (composed \nof the basic standard deduction, the additional standard deduc-\ntion for the blind or the elderly, and the disaster loss standard \ndeduction) and total itemized deductions, showed an increase \nof 3.5% to $3.3 trillion for TY 2022 (Figure C). Most tax re-\nturns (88.5%) claimed a standard deduction, and standard de-\nductions accounted for 79.6% of total deductions. In compari-\nson, for 2021, the standard deduction was taken on 88.2% of \nreturns and accounted for 79.2% of total deductions. The total \namount of the standard deduction claimed for TY 2022 rose \n4.1%, while the average standard deduction claimed increased \nfrom $17,667 for 2021 to $18,275 for 2022. \nTaxpayers claimed itemized deductions on only 9.5% of \nall returns filed, representing 20.4% of the total deduction \namount for the year. The average for total itemized deduc-\ntions was $43,686 for 2022, down from the $44,445 average \ntotal claimed for 2021. The number of returns with itemized \ndeductions increased 3.0% to 15.3 million returns. Table 2.1 \npresents detailed statistics for individual returns with itemized \ndeductions by type of deduction and size of AGI. \nThe largest itemized deduction for 2021 was charitable \ncontributions, followed by interest paid and then taxes paid. \nCharitable contributions decreased 15.5% from 2021 to $222.4 \nbillion despite the number of returns with these contributions

This large increase happened because \nthe enhanced child tax credit enacted by the American Rescue \nPlan Act of 2021 was not extended for TY 2022, so the en-\nhanced child tax credit was no longer refundable. Combining \nthis credit with the refundable child tax credit (used to offset \nincome tax before credits) resulted in a total nonrefundable \nchild and other dependent credit of $84.2 billion (54.4% of \ntotal tax credits used to offset income tax) for 2022. This rep-\nresented a 26.9% increase for this total from 2021. \nRefundable credits were broken out into three parts: the \nportion used to offset income tax before credits, the portion \nused to offset all other taxes, and the refundable portion. The \nfirst portion, which was included in total tax credits, offsets \nincome tax before credits. The second portion offsets all other \ntaxes besides income tax, such as the self-employment tax. \nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treated the last portion, \nthe refundable portion, as a refund and paid it directly to tax-\npayers who had no tax against which to apply the credits, or \nwhose credits exceeded income tax (and other income-related \ntaxes). The last two portions of refundable credits were not \nincluded in total tax credits. \nBecause the law changes enacted by the American Rescue \nPlan Act were not extended for 2022 for both the child tax \ncredit and child and dependent care credit, total refund-\nable credits were significantly decreased. In total, taxpay-\ners claimed $112.7 billion in refundable tax credits, a 51.7% \ndecrease from 2021. Of this, $6.2 billion were applied against \nincome taxes and $12.3 billion were applied against all other \ntaxes. The remaining $94.2 billion in refundable credits was \nrefunded to taxpayers. The enhanced child tax credit enacted \nby the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was not extended \nfor TY 2022. For 2021, the child and dependent care credit \nwas increased and most of the benefits were made refundable, \nhowever, for 2022, these benefits were not extended and the \nchild and dependent care credit was not refundable. The total \nearned income credit also fell by 8.5% from 2021 to $60.1 \nbillion, 83.8% of which was refundable. \nThe portion of refundable credits applied against income \ntaxes accounted for 5.5% of total refundable credits. The por-\ntion used to offset all other taxes accounted for 10.9% of the \ntotal, while the last portion, the refundable portion, was the \nlargest piece at 83.6%. \nTotal Income Tax and Average Tax Rates \nTotal income tax, as presented in these statistics, is the sum of \nincome tax after credits (including the subtraction of refund-\nable credits such as the EIC, American opportunity credit, net \npremium tax credit, regulated investment company credit, and \nchild tax credit) plus the net investment income tax and tax \non accumulation distribution of trusts from Form 4970 and is \nlimited to zero (it cannot be negative). This calculation does \nnot account for the impact of refundable credits, which have \nthe potential effect of creating a negative tax liability for some \ntaxpayers. This was accounted for by subtracting the portion \nof refundable credits that offset all other taxes, and the refund-\nable portion of credits, from total income tax. Total income \ntax minus refundable credits decreased 0.7% to $2.0 trillion \nfor 2022 (Figure E). \nThe alternative minimum tax decreased by 26.7% to $4.1 \nbillion. The number of returns with AMT liability also fell, \nFigure E \nIndividual Income Tax Returns: Total Income Tax, Tax Years 2021 and 2022 \n[Number of returns is in thousands—money amounts are in millions of dollars] \nItem \n2021 \n2022 \nPercentage change \nNumber \nof \nreturns \nAmount \nNumber \nof \nreturns \nAmount \nNumber \nof \nreturns \nAmount \nTotal income tax \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \n(5) \n(6) \n104,574 \n2,196,348 \n110,640 \n2,139,922 \n5.8 \n-2.6 \nTotal income tax minus refundable credits [1] \n145,338  \n2,047,980  \n141,252  \n2,033,060  \n-2.8 \n-0.7  \n Alternative minimum tax \n244    \n5,599 \n198    \n4,102    \n-18.7   \n-26.7    \n Net investment income tax \n7,211 \n59,698 \n7,141 \n40,994 \n-1.0  \n-31.3 \nAll other taxes \n33,571 \n104,554    \n36,666   \n111,568 \n9.2 \n6.7     \n Self-employment tax \n21,622   \n77,180    \n22,435 \n81,017   \n3.8   \n5.0\n Penalty tax on qualified retirement plans \n4,484 \n5,200 \n4,789 \n5,646 \n6.8 \n8.6     \n Additional Medicare tax \n6,029 \n14,591   \n6,974 \n15,087   \n15.7   \n3.4  \nTotal tax liability \n108,227  \n2,287,568  \n116,295  \n2,238,646  \n7.5  \n-2.1 \n[1] Refundable credits includes only the portion that is refundable and the part used to offset other taxes. \nSOURCE: IRS, Statistics of Income Division, Publication 1304, October 2024. \n27 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nIndividual Income Tax Returns, 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecreasing 18.7%, from 244,000 for 2021 to 198,000 for 2022. \nCorrelated with the large decrease in net capital gains cited \nabove, the net investment income tax showed a decrease for \n2022. The amount of this tax fell by 31.3% to $41.0 billion, \nwhile the number of returns on which it was applied decreased \n1.0%.  \nThe average tax rate (total income tax minus refundable \ncredits divided by AGI for all returns) was 13.7% for 2022 \n(Figure F). All income groups had higher average tax rates \nfor 2022 as opposed to 2021 if AGI was under $200,000. The \nlargest increase in average tax rates between 2021 and 2022, \nfor those income groups with a positive tax rate, was in the \n$30,000-under-$50,000 income group, an increase of 0.5 per-\ncentage points. \nIn 2022, average tax rates that were calculated incorporat-\ning refundable credits were similar to average tax rates without \nincorporating refundable credits for taxpayers with an AGI of \n$50,000 or more. However, the rates calculated in these two \nways differed for taxpayers with an AGI under $50,000. The \ngreatest disparities in rates were in the $10,000-under-$20,000 \nAGI class (a 12.3-percentage-point difference) and $1-under-\n$10,000 AGI class (an 11.0-percentage-point difference). \nAverage tax rates peaked at 27.7% for returns in the AGI \nclass $2 million under $5 million. For the classes above this \nlevel, the average tax rate declined to 27.6% and 25.3% for tax-\npayers with AGI between $5 million and $10 million and AGI \nof $10 million or more, respectively. The main reason for this \ndecline was that individuals in these classes tended to report \na larger percent of their AGI as long-term capital gains (more \nthan short-term losses) and qualified dividends, compared to \nindividuals in the lower AGI classes. This income was taxed \nat a maximum rate of 20% (23.8% including the net invest-\nment tax) as opposed to up to a 37% rate for ordinary income \n(40.8% including the net investment tax). For example, while \nindividuals reporting AGI of $1.5 million under $2 million \naveraged 21.4% of their income as capital gains and dividends \nfacing lower rates, this share increased in each succeeding \nclass, reaching 51.5% for those individuals reporting AGI of \n$10 million or more. More historical data on average tax rates \nare available in Section 3, Individual Income Tax Rates. In \naddition, a historical overview of different tax periods is pro-\nvided there for more perspective. \nAffordable Care Act \nA major tax law change, the implementation of certain provi-\nsions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (Public Law 111-148), \ntook effect in 2014. The ACA contained comprehensive health \ninsurance reforms and included tax provisions that affected in-\ndividuals. It also established the premium tax credit (PTC) for \ntaxpayers who enroll in a qualified health plan (QHP) offered \nthrough a Marketplace. The PTC provided financial assistance \nto help pay QHP premiums by reducing the amount of tax \nowed or providing a refund. The PTC was claimed at the time \nthe taxpayer filed his or her return. The advance premium tax \ncredit (APTC) was a payment during the year to the taxpayer’s \ninsurance provider that paid for part of or all the premiums. A \ntaxpayer’s APTC eligibility was based on the Marketplace’s \nestimate of the PTC that the taxpayer would be able to claim \non his or her tax return. The difference between the APTC \nthat was paid during the year and the final value of the PTC \nare reconciled on Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit, which is \nfiled with the taxpayer’s return. If the APTC was more than \nthe PTC, the taxpayer had to repay this excess, subject to a \nlimit. If the PTC was more than the APTC, the excess was \nused to reduce the taxpayer’s tax payment or to increase the \ntaxpayer’s refund. \nThe total PTC from Form 8962 was taken on 7.9 million \nreturns for 2022 (an increase of 6.1% from 2021), for a total of \n$54.0 billion (up 3.2%) (Figure G). Also, for 2022, some 8.6 \nmillion returns (up 9.9%) reported an APTC on Form 8962, \ntotaling $61.1 billion (up 13.2%). When the PTC and APTC \nwere reconciled, 2.3 million returns (a 46.6% decrease) re-\nceived a net PTC totaling $2.4 billion (down 34.1%), and 5.1 \nmillion returns (up 95.1%) had to repay excess APTCs of $7.0 \nbillion (up 81.3%). \nFor more 2022 changes in law and Internal Revenue \nService administrative changes, see Section 1 of this publica-\ntion. Section 3 of this publication has more information on \nincome tax rates and the AMT. All the statistics are based on a \nsample of individual income tax returns (Form 1040 and Form \n1040-SR, including electronically filed returns) filed during \nCalendar Year 2023.

    "text": "Section 3  \nIndividual Income  \nTax Rates, 2022 \nT\nhis section discusses the individual income tax rates and \nthe computation of “total income tax” for Tax Year (TY) \n2022. It provides explanations of selected terms and \ndescribes the income tax structure, certain tax law changes, \nincome and tax concepts (“modified” taxable income and mar-\nginal tax rates), and the computation of “alternative minimum \ntaxable income.” \nIncome Tax Rates \nThis part focuses on two distinct tax rates: average tax rates \nand marginal tax rates. Average tax rates are calculated by \ndividing some measure of tax by some measure of income. \nFor the statistics provided here, the average tax rate was “total \nincome tax” (see Explanation of Terms section) divided by \nadjusted gross income (AGI) reported on returns showing \nincome tax liability. \nMeasures of marginal tax rates focus on determining the \nstatutory tax rate imposed on the last (or next) dollar of income \nreceived by a taxpayer. (See Income and Tax Concepts in this \nsection for a more detailed explanation.) A more detailed de-\nscription of the measurement of average and marginal tax rates \nand a discussion of the statistics based on these rates for 2022 \nare found below. \nFigure A presents statistics for 1986-2022 on income \n(based on each year’s definition of AGI) and taxes reported. \nThese tax years can be partitioned into 10 distinct periods: \n1)  TY 1986—This was the last year under the Economic \nRecovery Tax Act of 1981. The tax bracket boundaries, \npersonal exemptions, and standard deductions were in-\ndexed for inflation, and the maximum tax rate was 50%. \n2) TY 1987—This was the first year under the Tax Reform Act \nof 1986 (TRA86). For 1987, a one-year, transitional, five-\nrate tax bracket structure was established with a partial \nphase-in of new provisions that broadened the definition \nof AGI. The maximum tax rate was 38.5%. \n3)  TYs 1988–1990—During this period, there was effectively \na three-rate tax bracket structure.1 The phase-in of the pro-\nvisions of TRA86 continued with a maximum tax rate of \n33%. \n4) TYs 1991–1992—These years brought a three-rate tax \nbracket structure (with a maximum tax rate of 31%), a \nlimitation on some itemized deductions, and a phaseout \nof personal exemptions for some upper-income taxpayers. \n5)  TYs 1993–1996—This period had a five-rate tax bracket \nstructure (with a maximum statutory tax rate of 39.6%), \na limitation on some itemized deductions, and a phaseout \nof personal exemptions for some upper income taxpayers. \n6) TYs 1997–2000—These years were subject to the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, which added three new capital gain tax \nrates to the previous rate structure to form a new eight-rate \ntax bracket structure (with a maximum statutory tax rate of \n39.6%). For a more detailed description of the capital gain \nrates, see Income and Tax Concepts below. \n7) TYs 2001–2008—This period was affected mainly by \ntwo new laws, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) and the Jobs and \nGrowth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA). \nEGTRRA included a new 10% tax rate bracket, as well as \nreductions in tax rates for brackets higher than 15% of one-\nhalf percentage point for 2001 and one percentage point for \n2002. It also included increases in the child tax credit and \nan increase in Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) exemp-\ntions. Under JGTRRA, TY 2003 saw additional rate reduc-\ntions (accelerations of EGTRRA’s phased in reductions) in \nordinary marginal tax rates higher than the 15% rate, as \nwell as expansions to income thresholds in the rates from \nFor TYs 1988-1990, the tax rate schedules provided only two basic rates: 15% and 28%. However, taxable income over certain levels was subject to a 33% tax rate to phase out the benefit of \nthe 15% tax bracket (as compared to the 28% rate) and the deduction for personal exemptions. At the taxable income level where these benefits were completely phased out, the tax rate returned \nto 28%. \n31 \n1 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nIndividual Income Tax Rates, 2022\n \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure A.

The rate for most long-term capital gains \nwas reduced from 20% to 15%; further, qualified dividends \nwere taxed at this same 15% rate. Beginning in 2004, the \nWorking Families Tax Relief Act increased the additional \nchild tax credit refundable rate from 10% to 15%. Under \nEGTRRA, beginning in 2006, the complete phaseout of \npersonal exemptions and the limitation on some itemized \ndeductions for upper-income taxpayers were modified to \nlimit the maximum phaseout to two-thirds of the exemption \namount and the itemized deduction limitation amount. For \n2008, the limit was changed to one-third.    \n8) TYs 2009–2012—Beginning in 2009, the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) temporarily in-\ncreased the earned income credit by modifying calculations \n32 \nIndividual Income Tax Rates, 2022\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non qualifying earned income amounts and phaseout ranges. \nThe Act increased eligibility for receiving the refundable \nportion of the child tax credit for 2009 and 2010 by lower-\ning the earned income floor from $8,500 to $3,000. For \n2009 and 2010, the ARRA provided an American oppor-\ntunity tax credit of up to $2,500 per student of the cost of \ntuition and related expenses. For those same years, ARRA \nalso included other selected major individual income tax \nprovisions: a temporary refundable first-time homebuyers \ncredit of up to $8,000, which expired July 31, 2011; a tem-\nporary suspension of federal income tax on the first $2,400 \nof unemployment compensation for 2009; an additional \ndeduction for state sales and excise taxes on the purchase \nof certain motor vehicles; a $250 credit for certain govern-\nment retirees; an aggregate cap of $1,500 on residential \nenergy credits for 2009 and 2010; and a 2-year making-\nwork-pay refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working \nindividuals and $800 for working families. For 2011, the \nTax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2010 (TRJCA) contin-\nued both the American opportunity credit and increased \neligibility for receiving the refundable portion of the child \ntax credit. At the same time, TRJCA reduced the maxi-\nmum amount for residential energy credits from $1,500 to \na lifetime limit of $500. The other provisions of the ARRA \ncited above have been eliminated for 2011 and beyond. \n9) TYs 2013–2017—Beginning in 2013, a new tax law rein-\nstituted the top tax bracket of 39.6%. The 15% maximum \ntax rate on net capital gains and qualified dividends in-\ncreased to 20% for certain high taxable income taxpayers. \nAdditionally, in this period a new net investment income \ntax was created. Taxpayers paid a net investment income \ntax of 3.8% on the smaller of (a) net investment income or \n(b) the excess of the taxpayer’s modified AGI over $125,000 \nfor married filing separately filers, $250,000 for married \nfiling jointly filers, and $200,000 for single taxpayers or \nheads of household. \n10) TYs 2018–2022—Beginning in 2018, a new tax law, Public \nLaw 115–97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and \nJobs Act (TCJA), reduced most tax rates. The tax rates for \nordinary (non-capital gain tax) income in 2018 through \n2022 were 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. \nIn 2017, the tax rates were 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, \n35%, and 39.6%. TCJA also increased (almost doubling) \nthe basic standard deduction for taxpayers who did not \nitemize deductions. The amount of increase depended on \nthe taxpayer’s filing status, whether the taxpayer was age \n65 or older, or whether the taxpayer was a dependent of \nanother person. For 2022, the basic standard deduction \nincreased to $25,900 for joint filers up from $25,100 for \n2021, up from $24,800 for 2020, up from $24,400 for 2019, \nand up from $24,000 for 2018. For single filers and mar-\nried filers filing separately, the deduction amount increased \nto $12,950 up from $12,550 in 2021, up from $12,400 in \n2020, up from $12,200 in 2019, and up from $12,000 for \n2018. For heads of households, the deduction was $19,400 \nup from $18,800 in 2021, up from $18,650 in 2020, up \nfrom $18,350 in 2019, and up from $18,000 for 2018. For \n2018-2022, the deduction for all personal taxpayer and de-\npendent exemptions was suspended. Also, the child tax \ncredit was doubled to $2,000 ($1,500 for the refundable \nportion) and a new credit for other dependents of $500 \nwas introduced in 2018. The AGI levels where these were \nphased out increased to $200,000 ($400,000 if married \nfiling jointly). In 2017, these were set at $75,000 ($110,000 \nfor married filing jointly and $55,000 for married filing \nseparately). For 2018–2022, a taxpayer’s overall itemized \ndeductions were no longer limited because AGI was over \na certain limit. There were multiple other law changes for \nitemized deductions in 2018 that continued in 2022, par-\nticularly limiting the deduction for state and local taxes \nto $10,000 ($5,000 for married filing separately). TCJA \nincreased the AMT exemption amount, which is subtracted \nfrom the Alternative Maximum Taxable Income (AMTI) \nprior to the application of the AMT tax rates. In conjunc-\ntion with this, the income levels at which the AMT exemp-\ntion began to phase out increased. Also, for 2022, the 26% \ntax rate applied to the first $199,900 ($99,950 if married \nfiling separately) of AMTI. Previously it applied to the first \n$206,100 ($103,050) of such income. TCJA also created a \nqualified business income deduction for 2018–2022. \nMarginal Tax Rate Classifications \nA return’s marginal tax rate is the highest statutory tax rate \nbracket applicable to that tax return. The marginal tax rate \nstatistics presented in this publication are based on all in-\ndividual income tax returns, as well as returns that show a \npositive taxable income amount based on “tax generated” (see \nExplanation of Terms section) and items of income that were \nsubject to the regular income tax, generally those included in \nAGI (Figure B, Table 3.4).2,3 Income and Tax Concepts (below) \nprovide an example showing how different portions of taxable \nincome are taxed at different rates and explain the determina-\ntion of the marginal tax rate bracket into which a return is \n2  Marginal tax rate as cited in this article is the highest statutory rate on taxable income. It includes ordinary tax rates and capital gains tax rates. This concept does not include the effects of AMT, \nnet investment tax, or tax credits. \n3  Tax generated does not include certain other taxes reported on the individual income tax return, such as self-employment tax (the Social Security and Medicare tax on income from self-\nemployment); the Social Security tax on certain tip income; household employment taxes; tax from the recapture of prior-year investment, low-income housing, or other credits; penalty tax \napplicable to early withdrawals from an IRA or other qualified retirement plans; and tax on trusts, accumulation, and distributions. The statistics for “total tax liability,” shown in Table 3.3, \ninclude these taxes. \n33 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nIndividual Income Tax Rates, 2022\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n         \n \n         \n \n    \n         \n         \nFigure B.

Table 3.5 contains additional data based on \nordinary tax rates and presents statistics on the income and tax \ngenerated at each ordinary tax rate by size of AGI. \nFigure B presents the amounts and percentages of modified \ntaxable income and income tax generated (before AMT and \nreduction by tax credits, including the earned income credit) \nby the marginal tax rate categories (defined in Income and Tax \nConcepts, below). \nReturns in the “12%” (ordinary income) marginal tax rate \nbracket made up the largest share of returns for 2022 (33.0%). \nThese returns reported 15.9% of modified taxable income for \n2022 and generated 9.1% of income tax (before credits and \nexcluding the AMT). Conversely, taxpayers’ highest “37%” \n(ordinary income) marginal rate accounted for only 0.7% of \nreturns but reported 20.2% of the modified taxable income and \n32.6% of the tax generated (the largest of any tax bracket). The \n“22%” (ordinary income) marginal rate bracket had the second \nlargest share of returns at 20.7% and reported the largest per-\ncentage (26.6%) of total modified taxable income and second \nhighest percentage of income tax generated (20.4%).

The \n“10%” (ordinary income) marginal rate bracket reported the \nfourth largest share of returns at 14.3%. However, such re-\nturns accounted for only 1.4% of modified income and 0.7% of \nincome tax generated. Returns in the “24%” (ordinary income) \nmarginal rate bracket represented only 7.3% of the total share \nof returns and accounted for 19.0% of the modified taxable \nincome and 18.4% of generated income tax. Returns in the \n“32%” (ordinary income) marginal rate bracket represented \nonly 1.1% of returns but accounted for 4.7% of the modified \ntaxable income and 5.2% of the tax generated. Returns in the \n“35%” (ordinary income) marginal rate bracket represented the \nthird smallest share of ordinary tax rate returns at 1.2% and \naccounted for 7.7% of the modified taxable income and 9.9% \nof the tax generated.

Table 3.4 includes two tax amounts: “tax \ngenerated” and “income tax after credits.” Figure A includes an \nadditional measure of tax, “total income tax,” that also includes \ndistributed tax on trust accumulations and the net investment \nincome tax. \nIn 2022, the tax generated by applying statutory ordinary \nincome and capital gain tax rates to modified taxable income \nwas $2.25 trillion, a 1.4% decrease from 2021 (Figure B and \ncolumn 5 of Table 3.4). For most taxpayers, tax generated was \nequal to income tax before credits. However, for some taxpay-\ners, income tax before credits included the AMT, an excess \nadvance premium tax credit repayment, and/or special taxes \non lump sum distributions from qualified retirement plans \n(when a 10-year averaging method was used) (see Alternative \nMinimum Tax, below, for explanation).4 \nFor returns with modified taxable income, Table 3.1 shows \nestimates of income tax before credits by type of tax computa-\ntion. It compares the amount of tax before credits—assuming \nthat all taxable income is subject to regular tax rates—with \nthe actual amount of tax before credits computed after reflect-\ning regular tax rates and any special tax computations that the \ntaxpayer is either permitted or required to make. For example, \nqualified dividends and long-term capital gains are generally \nsubject to lower tax rates, and certain dependent tax filers are \nrequired to compute their tax using the brackets and taxing un-\nearned income at their parents’ rates.5 The capital gain compu-\ntations generally reduce taxes; the special provision for certain \ndependent filers can only increase taxes. \nFor 2022, some 101.2 million returns had their tax before \ncredits computed using only regular income tax rates. This \nwas an increase of 1.2% from the 100.0 million for 2021 that \nused only regular tax computations. The top portion of Table \n3.1 shows the data for these returns. Since these returns did not \nuse any special tax computations, the difference due to special \ncomputation (shown in column 8) is zero. \nAs shown in the bottom portion of Table 3.1, for 2022, the \ntax liability for 27.9 million returns decreased by Schedule \nD (capital gains) and dividend tax computations. Taxpayers \nfiling these tax returns paid $201.0 billion (column 8) less in \ntax before credits than they would have paid if they had not \nreceived the benefits of the lower tax rates for qualified divi-\ndends and capital gains. For these taxpayers, the average tax \nsavings was $7,212. \nAs shown in the middle portion of Table 3.1, for 2022, there \nwere 232.6 thousand returns filed by dependents under age 18 \n(or under 24 for full-time students) with Form 8615, Tax for \nCertain Children Who Have Unearned Income, for reporting \ninvestment income greater than $2,300. Form 8615 was used \nto compute the dependents’ tax using their parents’ rates. This \nmandatory calculation can result in no change or an increase \nin tax before credits, and it cannot lower the dependent’s tax \nbefore credits. Thus, for Form 8615 filers, the difference in tax \nbefore credits due to special computations (column 8) reflects \nthe combination of the lower tax from use of the special tax \nrates for dividends and capital gains and the possibly higher tax \nfrom the required Form 8615 tax computation. The combina-\ntion of the two offsetting provisions increased taxes by $132.5 \nmillion for 2022 due to a tax reduction of $227.0 million from \nuse of dividends and capital gains, and a tax increase of $359.4 \nmillion (columns 4 and 8) from the Form 8615 tax computation \n(Table 3.1A).    \nAlternative Minimum Tax \nThe Revenue Act of 1978 established the AMT to ensure that \ntaxpayers, who might otherwise be able to legally reduce or \neliminate their tax burdens, paid a minimum amount of income \ntax. The AMT provisions may recapture some tax reduc-\ntions under the ordinary income tax. Form 6251, Alternative \nMinimum Tax—Individuals, is used to calculate AMT. (See \nComputation of Alternative Minimum Taxable Income, below, \nfor an explanation of the computation of income for AMT \npurposes.) \nTax law changes increased the AMT exemption amount, \nwhich is subtracted from AMTI prior to the application of the \nAMT tax rates. The maximum AMT exemption amount in-\ncreased from $114,600 in 2021 to $118,100 in 2022 for a married \ncouple filing a joint return, from $73,600 to $75,900 for single \nfilers and heads of household, and from $57,300 to $59,050 for \na married person filing separately. In conjunction with this, \nthe income levels at which the AMT exemption began to phase \nout increased to $539,900 from $523,600 ($1,079,800 from \n$1,047,200 if married filing jointly or a qualifying widow(er)). \nAlso, for 2022, the 26% tax rate applied to the first $206,100 \n($103,050 if married filing separately) of alternative minimum \ntaxable income. Previously it applied to the first $199,900 \n($99,950 if married filing separately) of such income. AMTI \nis defined as the taxpayer’s taxable income, determined after \ncertain adjustments, and increased by the amount of the items \n4  The income amounts on which these special computations for lump sum distributions were based were not reflected in current year AGI or current year taxable income. \n5  Dependents with income over $2,300 other than earned income could file their own returns, but were required to calculate their tax on other than earned income in excess of 2,300 as if it were \ntheir parent’s or guardian’s marginal income. Previously, for 2018 and 2019, they calculated this tax using the brackets and tax rates that were applied to estates and trusts (though a change \nin the law allowed the dependent to choose between these rates and being taxed at the parent’s rate for 2019 and retroactively for 2018). Form 8615 was used to compute the higher tax. For \ndependents with only modest amounts of investment income (less than $11,500), the parent or guardian could elect to include the dependent’s income on the parent’s tax return and fill out Form \n8814 for the dependent’s income, relieving the dependent of having to file his or her own tax return. \n36 \nIndividual Income Tax Rates, 2022\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \nFigure D.

Tax law changes to itemized deductions \n(including the limitation of state and local income, sales, and \nproperty taxes) and the standard deduction, and the introduc-\ntion of the qualified business income deduction, all had effects \non the taxpayer’s taxable income.  \nSome taxpayers included or were required to include Form \n6251 with their individual income tax returns, even though \ntheir tax liability was not increased due to the AMT (Figure \nD). For 2022, AMT liability decreased 26.7% to $4.1 billion \nfrom $5.6 billion in 2021. The number of returns subject to \npaying the AMT decreased from almost 244,000 in 2021 to \nover 198,000 returns in 2022 (down 18.7%).6 AMTI for all \nreturns filing a Form 6251 decreased 15.3% to $2.3 trillion \nfor 2022. \nNet Investment Tax \nIn 2013, the Affordable Care Act created a new net investment \nincome tax. Taxpayers paid a net investment income tax of \n3.8% on the smaller of (a) net investment income or (b) the \nexcess of the taxpayer’s modified AGI over $125,000 for mar-\nried filing separately filers, $250,000 for married filing jointly \nfilers, and $200,000 for single filers or heads of household. \nFor 2022, the net investment income tax totaled $41.0 billion \ndollars (a 31.3% decrease from 2021 levels) and was taken on \n7.1 million returns. \nIncome Tax Structure \nTaxpayers must file an income tax return if they meet certain \nminimum filing requirements. The filing requirements for \nOther tax returns may not have had AMT liability, but the size of their tax credits, for example their general business credits, may have been reduced because of the AMT. \n37 \n6 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nIndividual Income Tax Rates, 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2022 were generally based on the amount of “gross income,” \nfiling status, age, dependency, and blindness (see Introduction \nand Changes in Law, Section 1). Generally, for 2022, the mini-\nmum level of income for which a return was required to be \nfiled equaled the standard deduction. In addition to the general \nfiling requirements, individuals were required to file a return \nfor TY 2022 if they had net earnings from self-employment of \nat least $400; liability for Social Security or Medicare tax on \nunreported tip income; Social Security, Medicare, or Railroad \nRetirement tax on reported tip income or group-term life insur-\nance; were liable for household employment taxes; “alternative \nminimum tax”; tax on qualified retirement plan distributions, \nincluding an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or a \nMedical Savings Account; tax on the recapture of investment \ncredit, education credit, low-income housing credit, or a few \nother business credits; recapture tax on the disposition of a \nhome purchased with a federally subsidized mortgage; wages \nof $108.28 or more from a church or qualified church controlled \norganization that was exempt from Social Security taxes; or \nhad advance payments of the premium tax credit made for the \ntaxpayer, their spouse, or a dependent who enrolled in coverage \nthrough the Health Insurance Marketplace. \nGross income includes all income received as money, \ngoods, property, or services that was not expressly exempt \nfrom tax.7 AGI is equal to gross income less deductions for \ncertain expenses. For 2020, charitable deductions for nonitem-\nizers were deducted in the calculation of AGI, while for 2021 \nthese were deducted from AGI in the calculation of taxable \nincome. For 2022, these were no longer deducted for nonitem-\nizers. “Taxable income,” the base on which income tax before \ncredits is computed, equals AGI less the amount for either total \nallowable itemized deductions for taxpayers who itemize de-\nductions or the standard deduction (including the additional \namounts for age and blindness) for all other taxpayers. Prior \nto 2018, personal exemptions were also subtracted from AGI \nto arrive at “taxable income”; in 2018, personal exemptions \nwere eliminated. Starting with 2018, the qualified business \nincome deduction was also subtracted from AGI in calculat-\ning taxable income. Income tax before credits is calculated \nfrom taxable income using: tax tables or tax rate schedules, \nboth of which vary with taxpayer filing status (single, married \nfiling jointly, surviving spouse, married filing separately, and \nhead of household); Form 8615 or Form 8814, Parents Election \nTo Report Child’s Interest and Dividends for children’s in-\nvestment income; Schedule J for farmers and fishermen to \nincome-average; foreign-earned income worksheet; Schedule \nD and Qualified Dividends worksheet for net long-term capi-\ntal gains and qualified dividends; or some combination of \nthe above (see Explanation of Terms for definitions for above \nitems). The tax rates for each filing status were 0%, 10%, 12%, \n22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and a top tax rate of 37%. The tax rates \nof 0%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 28% were used for qualified divi-\ndends and net long-term capital gains (in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses). The 26% tax rate was only for the AMT. \nIncome tax before credits includes any AMT.8 \nTo calculate their federal income tax liability for 2022, \ntaxpayers used either the tax table or the tax rate schedules. \nTaxpayers with taxable income less than $100,000 were re-\nquired to use the tax table, whereas those with taxable income \nof $100,000 or more were required to use the tax rate sched-\nules. The tax table was based on income tax “brackets” up to \n$50 wide.9 The tax within each bracket was based on the tax \ncalculated at the midpoint of the bracket and then rounded to \nthe nearest whole dollar. As a result, the tax tables and the tax \nrate schedules could produce different amounts of tax for the \nsame amount of taxable income. Use of the tax tables could \nhave produced either a slightly higher or lower amount of tax \nthan that produced by the tax rate schedules.  \nIncome and Tax Concepts \nAs discussed in Income Tax Structure above, gross income is all \nincome received that is not specifically excluded. Total income \nis the net amount of gross income after certain expenses (e.g., \nbusiness or rent and royalty expenses) have been deducted. \nAGI is total income less statutory adjustments to income (e.g., \ndeductible contributions to an IRA or Keogh plan). \nModified Taxable Income \nThis concept is relevant only for “prior-year returns” (about 8.0 \nmillion returns); certain farm sole proprietor returns using in-\ncome-averaging on Schedule J, Income Averaging for Farmers \nand Fishermen (about 100,100 returns); those returns with for-\neign-earned income having to use a worksheet to determine \ntheir taxes (about 176,100 returns); returns with Form 962 elec-\ntion for domestic shareholder of foreign controlled corporations \n(about 21,600 returns); or returns reporting repatriated deferred \n(Section 965) income as shareholders of certain foreign corpo-\nrations (about 11,300 returns). For all other returns, modified \ntaxable income is identical to taxable income. \n7  As defined under Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, gross income includes amounts from wages and salaries, interest and dividends, alimony, bartering income, canceled debt income, \ngambling winnings, rents and royalties, and gains from property sales or exchanges, as well as gross income from sole proprietorships and farming, income from partnerships and S corpora-\ntions, and distributions from estates and trusts. This definition of gross income is slightly different from that of Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, and the concept of “total income,” \nwhich is a component of the AGI calculation on Form 1040. Total income includes net amounts rather than gross amounts (income prior to deductions) from such items as business income and \nrents and royalties. \n8  Income tax before credits includes tax on lump sum distributions from qualified retirement plans and excess advance premium tax credit repayment. \n9  For taxable income between $0 and $5 and between $5 and $25, the tax brackets were $5 and $10 wide, respectively. For taxable income between $25 and $3,000, the brackets were $25 wide. \nFor taxable income above $3,000, the brackets were $50 wide. \n38 \nIndividual Income Tax Rates, 2022\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n      \n      \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure E.

Each \nyear, a small number of returns for prior tax years are filed \nduring the same Calendar Year in which the tax returns for the \ncurrent tax year are being selected for the Statistics of Income \nsample. Some of these returns are selected for the sample and \nact as proxies for returns for the current tax year that will be \nfiled during a later calendar year. The tax on these returns is \nbased on a previous year’s tax law (which may reflect differ-\nent tax rates and income concepts). For the statistics in this \npublication, the taxable incomes reported on these prior-year \nreturns and those filed with a Schedule J or foreign-earned \nincome or basing tax on Form 962 or Section 965 are modified \nto equal an amount necessary to generate the tax shown on \nthese returns using current year rates. \nMarginal Tax Rates \nUnder the progressive U.S. income tax rate structure, different \nportions of taxable income are taxed at different rates. Figure E \nillustrates how income tax is determined for a single taxpayer \nwith AGI of $575,000 who used the standard deduction. As \nshown in the example, seven different tax rates were applied \nto the taxable income to arrive at total tax. For this example, \nthe tax rate applied to the last dollar of income (given certain \nassumptions about which source of income provided the last \ndollar of income subject to tax) is the marginal tax rate for that \nreturn, so for this case the marginal tax rate is 37%. \nSince the individual income tax structure includes vari-\nous types of income, deductions, exclusions, credits, and taxes \nthat are not subject to the same treatment under tax laws, the \nmarginal tax rate is not always apparent. Calculating marginal \ntax rates for a specific individual income tax return generally \ndepends on the types and amounts of income reported and \nthe assumptions made about the order in which the income is \ntaxed, particularly which type of income is assumed to be re-\nceived “last.” Additional complexity is added by the presence \nof such items as the AMT and various tax credits. \nFor this publication, it is assumed that the income taxed \nat the marginal (highest) rate was the “last” income received. \nThe AMT and income tax credits, such as the earned income \ncredit, are excluded in determining the marginal tax rates. The \nmarginal tax rate is defined as follows: \n1)  If a return showed taxable income, the marginal tax rate \nof the return was the highest statutory rate at which any \namount of taxable income reported on the return was \ntaxed. \n2)  If the return had no taxable income except for net long-\nterm capital gains or qualified dividends and that amount \nwas less than or equal to the 12% tax bracket limit, the \nreturn was defined as having a “0%” marginal tax rate. If \nthe return had taxable income (from other than net long-\nterm capital gains or qualified dividends) to which only \nthe 12% tax rate applied, as well as net long-term capital \ngains to which the 15%, 20% or 25% rate on the net gain \napplied, the return was defined as having a marginal tax \nrate equal to the maximum rate at which the net gains were \ntaxed. If the return had taxable income (from other than net \nlong-term capital gains) to which the 24% tax rate applied \nas the highest rate, as well as net long-term capital gains to \nwhich the maximum 25% or 28% rate on net gain applied, \nthe return was defined as having a “25%” or “28%” mar-\nginal tax rate. However, if the return had taxable income \n(from other than net long-term capital gains or qualified \ndividends) above the maximum amount to which the 24% \nrate applied, as well as net long-term capital gains to which \nthe 25% or 28% rate on the net gain applied, the return was \nclassified as having the highest rate at which any amount of \ntaxable income reported on the return was taxed. \n3)  For returns of dependents with the Form 8615 (attached), \nand when use of this form resulted in taxation of some of \nthe dependent’s income at the estate tax brackets and rates \nor their parents’ rates, the return was classified as having a \nForm 8615 marginal tax rate (the returns in the Form 8615 \nclassification are not distributed by tax rate). \n4) For returns of parents choosing to report interest, dividend, \nand capital gain distribution income of their dependents \nunder age 18 (or under 24 if students) on their own (i.e., \nthe parents’) return using Form 8814 when the dependent’s \nincome generated the only tax liability on the parents’ \nreturn, the return was classified with a Form 8814 mar-\nginal tax rate of 10%. \nThe classification of returns into marginal tax rate cat-\negories for Statistics of Income purposes was essentially a \nfunction of filing status, size of taxable income, presence of \n39 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nIndividual Income Tax Rates, 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnet long-term capital gains (in excess of net short-term capi-\ntal losses) and/or qualified dividends, and presence of Form \n8615 or Form 8814. Returns were classified into one of the \nfollowing 15 mutually exclusive marginal tax rate categories: \n(1) 0% rate; (2) 0% (capital gains); (3) 10% rate; (4) Form 8814 \n(10% rate with no tax liability other than that generated by the \ndependent’s income); (5) 12% rate; (6) 15% (capital gains); (7) \n20% rate (capital gains); (8) 22% rate; (9) 24% rate; (10) 25% \n(capital gains); (11) 28% (capital gains); (12) 32% rate; (13) 35% \nrate; (14) 37% rate; and (15) Form 8615 (with income taxed at \nany rate). \nTable 3.4 presents statistics by marginal tax rate classifica-\ntion and filing status for returns with modified taxable income. \nFor each marginal rate classification, modified taxable income \nand “income tax generated” were computed “at all rates” and \n“at marginal rate.” The “at all rates” computations (columns \n3 and 5) show the total amount of modified taxable income \nor tax generated, tabulated by the marginal tax rate speci-\nfied; each tax rate classification is mutually exclusive. The \n“at marginal rate” computations (columns 4 and 6) report the \nspecific amounts of modified taxable income taxed, and the \ntax generated at the marginal tax rate shown, for all returns \nin each marginal rate classification. Although the AMT was \nnot included in the determination of the marginal tax rate, we \nshow at what rate individuals with AMT have been classified \nand the amount of AMT that was paid (columns 10 and 11). \nWe also show the number of returns and net investment tax \npaid (columns 12 and 13). \nFor example, consider returns in the “returns of married \npersons filing jointly and returns of surviving spouses” filing \nstatus that were included in the “32%” marginal tax rate clas-\nsification. The total modified taxable income for the estimated \n941,348 returns in this classification “at all rates” was $397.3 \nbillion (column 3), and the total tax generated was $84.6 bil-\nlion (column 5). Approximately $38.3 billion (column 4) of the \nmodified taxable income was subject to tax at the marginal tax \nrate of 32%. This modified taxable income generated $12.3 bil-\nlion (column 6) in tax at the 32% tax rate with the remainder \ngenerated at some, or all, of the lower tax rates. Some 14,593 \nreturns (1.6%) paid AMT while 730.467 (77.6%) of these re-\nturns paid a net investment tax. \nTable 3.5 provides statistics on the tax generated (regular \ntax before credits), in total and at each tax rate bracket, for \nreturns with modified taxable income. Returns in this table \nare classified by size of AGI. The tax generated at each tax \nrate was computed based on the modified taxable income for \neach individual return. \nFor example, the 1.7 million returns included in the \n“$500,000 under $1,000,000” income-size classification \nshowed total modified taxable income of $1,029.6 billion and \ngenerated total tax of $259.7 billion. Of this $1,029.6 billion \nof modified taxable income, $31.3 billion were taxed at 10% \n(ordinary tax rate); $95.0 billion were taxed at 12% (ordinary \ntax rate); $138.4 billion were taxed at the 22% (ordinary tax) \nrate; $227.3 billion were taxed at the 24% (ordinary tax) rate; \n$119.4 billion were taxed at the 32% rate; $214.2 billion were \ntaxed at the 35% rate; and $62.0 billion were taxed at the 37% \nrate. Approximately $2.9 billion were taxed at the 0% (capital \ngains) rate; $79.5 billion were taxed at the 15% capital gain and \nqualified dividend rate; $56.3 billion were taxed at the 20% \ncapital gain rate; $2.9 billion were taxed at the 25% capital gain \nrate; $0.2 billion were taxed at the 28% capital gain rate; and \nthe remainder from tax related to Forms 8814 and 8615. \nTable 3.6 presents statistics on the income and tax gener-\nated at each tax rate, by filing status, for returns with modified \ntaxable income. A little over 2.8 million of the 48.9 million \nreturns of married persons filing jointly (including surviving \nspouses) with modified taxable income had some income taxed \nat the 32% tax rate. For these returns, the taxable income sub-\nject to this rate was $211.8 billion, and the tax generated was \n$67.8 billion. \nComputation of Alternative Minimum Taxable \nIncome \nAMTI was computed by adding certain “tax preferences” (i.e., \ndeduction or exclusion amounts identified as potential sources \nof tax savings disallowed for AMT purposes) and “adjust-\nments” (i.e., regular tax deduction amounts recomputed or ex-\ncluded for AMT purposes) to taxable income. Prior to 2018, any \ndeductions for personal exemptions were then subtracted. In \n2018 personal exemptions were eliminated. The “net operating \nloss deduction” was recomputed to allow for the exclusion of \nthe “tax preference items” and “adjustments” used to reduce \nregular tax liability. The recomputed net operating loss deduc-\ntion, termed the “alternative net operating loss deduction,” was \nlimited to 90% of AMTI (with certain minor exceptions for \n2022) (Figures F and G). \nFigure F.

The maximum AMT exemp-\ntion amount increased from $114,600 in 2021 to $118,100 in \n2022 for a married couple filing a joint return, from $73,600 \nto $75,900 for single filers and heads of household, and from \n$57,300 to $59,050 for a married person filing separately. In \nconjunction with this, the income levels at which the AMT \nexemption began to phase out increased to $539,900 from \n$523,600 ($1,079,800 from $1,047,200 if married filing jointly \nor a qualifying widow(er)). After reduction by the exemption, \nthe first $206,100 ($103,050 if married filing separately) of the \nremaining AMTI was subject to tax at a 26% rate, with any \nexcess taxed at a 28% rate. However, capital gains and qualified \ndividends (recalculated for AMT purposes) that were taxed at \nlower rates (0%, 15%, 20%, and 25%) were taxed at these same \nrates for the AMT, with the rest of AMTI being taxed at the \nrates mentioned above (26% or 28%). The resulting tax was \nreduced by the “alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit,” \nwhich produced a “tentative minimum tax.” Tentative mini-\nmum tax was further reduced by the individual’s regular tax \nbefore credits (excluding tax on lump sum distributions from \nqualified retirement plans) less the foreign tax credit (for regu-\nlar tax purposes) to yield the AMT. \nFor 2019–2022, and retroactively for 2018, dependents \nfiling Form 6251 calculated AMT exemptions the same as all \ntaxpayers. Prior to this, dependents filing their own returns \nwere limited to an AMT exemption of $7,500 plus their “earned \nincomes.” \n42",

(All tables and \nfigures included in this article are for total individual income \ntax returns filed excluding dependent returns. See Table 1.7 \nfor details on dependent tax returns.) The tables show distri-\nbutions of AGI for each tax year by descending and ascend-\ning cumulative percentiles of returns, respectively, and can \nbe used to make comparisons across cumulative percentile \nclasses within each year. Table 4.1 shows percentiles of re-\nturns cumulated downward, starting with the highest income \nreturns, and presents data for 14 different percentiles from \nthe top 0.001% through the top 50% of all returns. Table 4.2 \nshows percentiles of returns cumulated upward, starting with \nthe lowest income returns, and presents data for the bottom \n5 percentiles: 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, and 99% of all returns. \nFor TY 2022, nondependent taxpayers filed 153.8 million \nindividual income tax returns (Table 4.1), an increase of 0.1% \nfrom the 153.6 million returns filed for TY 2021. Total AGI \nalso increased 0.2% to $14.8 trillion in 2022. However, total \nincome tax decreased 2.6% to $2.1 trillion. \nFor TY 2022, the top 0.001% of individual income tax \nreturns had an AGI of at least $85.5 million, which was a \nsignificant decrease of 27.6% from the previous year when \nthe top 0.001% of tax returns had an AGI of at least $118.0 \nmillion (Figure A). These returns accounted for 2.4% of total \nAGI in TY 2022, down from 3.0% in TY 2021, and they \nalso accounted for 3.8% of the total income tax in TY 2022 \n(Figure B), down from 4.7% in TY 2021.

Medicare wages and self-employment were combined \nto determine if a taxpayer exceeded these thresholds; however, \na self-employment loss was not considered for purposes of \nthis tax. Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) compensation \nwas separately compared to this threshold. A taxpayer’s em-\nployer was responsible for withholding the 0.9% Additional \nMedicare Tax on Medicare wages or RRTA compensation paid \nin excess of $200,000 regardless of a taxpayer’s filing status. \nIf a taxpayer was married filing jointly and either the taxpayer \nor spouse had wages or RRTA compensation of more than \n$200,000, the taxpayer may have been able to get a refund of \nthe tax withheld. Besides the Additional Medicare Tax, with-\nholding reconciliation was calculated on Form 8959 and added \nto Form 1040, line 25c, as part of income tax withheld. \nAdditional Standard Deduction \n(included in line 12, Form 1040) \nSee “Standard Deduction.” \nAdditional Taxes \n(line 16(2), Form 1040) \nTaxes calculated on Form 4972, Tax on Lump-Sum  \nDistributions, were reported here. \nAdjusted Gross Income Less Deficit ∆\n(line 11, Form 1040) \nAdjusted gross income (AGI) is defined as total income \n(line 9, Form 1040) minus statutory adjustments (line 26, \nSchedule 1, and line 10, Form 1040). Total income included: \n•  Compensation for services, including wages, salaries, \nfees, commissions, tips, taxable fringe benefits, and \nsimilar items; \n•  Taxable interest received; \n•  Ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions; \n•  Taxable refunds of state and local income taxes; \n•  Alimony and separate maintenance payments; \n•  Net income or loss derived from a business, profession, \nor farm; \n•  Net gain or loss from the sale of capital assets; \n•  Net gain or loss from the sale of business property; \n•  Taxable amounts of annuities, pensions, and individual \nretirement arrangement (IRA) distributions; \n•  Rents and royalties; \n•  Distributive share of partnership or S corporation net \nincome or loss; \n•  Net income or loss from an estate or trust; \n•  Unemployment compensation; \n•  Net operating loss (NOL) deduction; \n•  Gambling winnings; \n•  Canceled debts; \n•  Taxable distributions from a health savings account or \nArcher medical savings account (MSA); \n•  Jury duty pay; \n•  Prizes and awards; \n•  Income from an activity not engaged in for profit; \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n•  Stock options; \n•  Income from the rental of personal property engaged \nin for profit; \n•  Olympic and Paralympic medals and USOC prize \nmoney; \n•  Income of a U.S. shareholder of a controlled foreign \ncorporation for pro rata share of subpart F income; \n•  Global intangible low-taxed income; \n•  Limitation on business loss; \n•  Taxable distributions from an ABLE account; \n•  Taxable amounts of Social Security and railroad retire-\nment (Tier 1) payments; \n•  Taxable distributions from a Coverdell education sav-\nings account or qualified tuition program; \n•  Section 965 income; \n•  Amounts received that were claimed as a deduction or \ncredit in a prior year; \n•  Bartering income; \n•  Alaska permanent fund dividends; \n•  Alternative trade adjustment assistance payments; \n•  Loss on certain corrective distributions of excess \ndeferrals; \n•  Dividends on insurance policies if they exceeded the \ntotal of all net premiums paid; \n•  Recapture of a charitable contribution deduction relat-\ning to the contribution of a fractional interest in tan-\ngible personal property; \n•  Recapture of a charitable contribution deduction if the \ncharitable organization disposed of the donated prop-\nerty within 3 years of the contribution; and \n• Taxable part of disaster relief payments. \nSome reported income was fully or partially excluded \nfrom total income for 2022. The following is a list of such \nitems: \n•  The cost basis of pension, annuity, or IRA payments \nor distributions; \n•  Tax-exempt interest; \n•  Limited exclusion of Social Security benefits and rail-\nroad retirement benefits (only required to be reported \nif there was also a taxable amount); \n•  Limited exclusion of qualified foreign-earned income; \nand \n•  Exclusion of part or all of the gain from the sale of \nprincipal residence up to $250,000 ($500,000 on joint \nreturns). \nThe following statutory adjustments (lines 11 through 25, \nSchedule 1) were subtracted, from total income to arrive at \nadjusted gross income (line 11, Form 1040): \n•  Educator expenses; \n•  Certain business expenses of reservists, performing \nartists, and fee-basis government officials; \n•  Health savings account deduction; \n•  Moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces; \n•  Deductible part of self-employment tax; \n•  Contributions to self-employed retirement plans \n(Keogh or simplified employee pension) and certain \ncontributions to IRAs; \n•  Self-employed health insurance deduction; \n•  Forfeited interest and penalties incurred by persons \nwho made premature withdrawals of funds from time \nsavings accounts; \n•  Alimony payments; \n•  IRA deductions; \n•  Certain student loan interest; \n•  Archer MSA deduction; \n•  Amount of jury duty pay reported on line 8h, Schedule \n1, that was repaid to employers; \n•  Deductible expenses related to income on line 8k from \nthe rental of personal property engaged in for profit; \n•  Nontaxable amount of the value of Olympic and \nParalympic medals and USOC prize money; \n•  Forestation or reforestation expenses; \n•  Repayments of supplemental unemployment \ncompensation; \n•  Contributions to section 501(c)(18)(D) pension plans; \n•  Contributions by certain chaplains to section 403(b) \nplans; \n•  Attorney fees and court costs paid for actions involving \ncertain unlawful discrimination claims, but only to the \nextent of gross income from such actions; \n•  Attorney fees and court costs paid in connection with \nan award from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for \ninformation provided that helped the IRS detect tax law \nviolations, but only to the amount of the award includ-\nable in gross income. \n•  Foreign housing exclusion; and \n•  Excess deductions of section 67(e) expenses from \nSchedule K-1. \nA deficit occurred if the allowable exclusions and de-\nductions exceeded gross income, i.e., the amount on line 26, \nSchedule 1, was greater than the amount on line 9, Form 1040, \nor if line 10, Schedule 1, was negative due to negative business \nor other income. \nAdjusted Gross Income or Loss\nSee “Adjusted Gross Income Less Deficit.” \nAdjustments\nSee “Statutory Adjustments.” \n311 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nExplanation of Terms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdoption Credit ∆\n(line 6c, Schedule 3) \nThis credit was available to taxpayers who paid qualified \nadoption expenses in 2022 for an adoption that was not final \nat the end of 2022, or for qualified expenses paid in 2022 for \nan adoption that was final in or before 2022. The credit could \nhave been as much as $14,890 for each eligible child. The \ncredit began to phase out if a taxpayer had a modified adjusted \ngross income (AGI) in excess of $223,410 and was completely \nphased out for a modified AGI of $263,410 or more. The adop-\ntion credit stopped being refundable at the end of 2011. (Form \n8839 was used to figure the adoption credit and any employer-\nprovided adoption benefits that could be excluded from the \ntaxpayer’s income.) \nAdvance Payment of Premium Tax Credit\n(line 25, Form 8962) \nA taxpayer may have been eligible for the premium tax \ncredit if they, their spouse, or a dependent enrolled in health \ninsurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace. The pre-\nmium tax credit was used to help pay for this health insurance. \nThe taxpayer may have elected to have all or part of the credit \npaid in advance, during the year, to the insurer. Advance pay-\nments were based on an estimate of the taxpayer’s income and \nfamily size for the coverage year. If advance payments of the \npremium tax credit were made, taxpayers must have filed a \n2022 tax return and Form 8962 to reconcile the amount paid in \nadvance with the amount of premium tax credit for which the \ntaxpayer was eligible, based on the taxpayer’s actual income \nand family size for the year. \nAlimony Paid\n(line 19a, Schedule 1) \nPayments made as alimony or separate maintenance \ncounted as a deduction (an adjustment to total income) for the \nperson paying them. \nAlimony Received\n(line 2a, Schedule 1) \nPayments received as alimony or separate maintenance \nwere income to the person receiving them. \nAll Other Taxes \n(individually at lines 2, 4, 7-11, 13-16, and 18 Schedule 2) \nIn this report, this amount includes the sum of the excess \nadvance premium tax credit (APTC) repayment; self-employ-\nment tax; unreported Social Security and Medicare taxes on \ntip income and wages; penalty tax on qualified retirement \nplans; household employment taxes; repayment of the first-\ntime homebuyer credit; Additional Medicare Tax; additional \ntaxes on health savings accounts; additional tax on Archer \nmedical savings account (MSA) distributions; additional tax \non Medicare Advantage MSA distributions; tax from the recap-\nture of the investment credit, the low-income housing credit, \nthe Indian employment credit, the new markets credit, credit \nfor employer-provided child care facilities, alternative motor \nvehicle credit, the alternative fuel vehicle refueling credit, and \nthe qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle credit; recap-\nture of federal mortgage subsidy; COBRA premium assistance;",

In this report, the \n“other taxes” portion differs from Form 1040, which included \nthe taxes listed above (except the excess APTC repayment) \nplus tax from Form 4970, Tax on Accumulation Distribution \nof Trusts, and tax from Form 8960, Net Investment Tax. These \nare instead included in “total income tax.” (See also “Taxable \nand Nontaxable Returns” and “Total Income Tax.”) \nAlternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property \nCredit \n(line 6j, Schedule 3) \nTaxpayers could have claimed this credit for any nonde-\npreciable alternative fuel vehicle refueling property placed in \nservice during the tax year. Qualified alternative fuel vehicle \nrefueling property is any property used to store or dispense an \nalternative fuel at the point where the fuel is delivered into a \nfuel tank of a motor vehicle propelled by the fuel. This credit \nwas calculated on Form 8911. \nAlternative Minimum Tax ∆ \n(line 1, Schedule 2) \nThe Revenue Act of 1978 established the alternative mini-\nmum tax (AMT) to ensure that a minimum amount of income \ntax was paid by taxpayers, who might otherwise be able to le-\ngally reduce, or totally eliminate, their tax burdens. The AMT \nwas levied on income, including benefits received in the form \nof deductions and exclusions, which reduced an individual’s \nregular effective tax rate. These benefits, known as “alterna-\ntive minimum tax preferences and adjustments,” resulted from \nthe treatment that the tax law gave to particular income and \nexpense items. \nAlternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) (line 4, \nForm 6251) was defined as taxable income for ordinary income \ntax purposes adjusted for net operating losses from other tax \nyears, plus adjustments and preferences. AMTI was then re-\nduced by an exemption amount determined by filing status \nand AMTI. If the return was filed jointly by a married couple \n312 \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor a surviving spouse, the maximum amount of the exemption \nwas $118,100. The maximum amount for a single or head of \nhousehold taxpayer was $75,900, and for a married couple \nfiling separately, $59,050. The AMT exclusion was phased out \nif AMTI exceeded certain levels. For single taxpayers, the \nphase-out began at $539,900 and ended at $843,500. For joint \nreturns or qualifying widow(er), the range was $1,079,800 to \n$1,552,200. For married couples filing separately, it began at \n$539,900 and was phased out at $776,100. \nIf there was an amount remaining after subtracting the ex-\nemption, the first $206,100 (the first $103,050 if married filing \nseparately) was taxed at a 26-percent rate; any excess was \ntaxed at a 28-percent rate, except capital gains, which were \ntaxed at the same rates under the AMT as under the regular \nincome tax. This amount was then reduced by the recalculated \nAMT foreign tax credit and regular income tax before credits \n(line 16, Form 1040, minus any tax from Form 4972 plus the \nadvanced payment of the premium tax credit minus the regular \nforeign tax credit, line 1, Schedule 3) to arrive at the AMT. \nPersonal credits (such as the child tax credit, child care \ncredit, etc.) and certain eligible small business credits could \nbe taken against the AMT.  \nAlternative Motor Vehicle Credit \n(included in line 6e, Schedule 3) \nTaxpayers could have used Form 8910 to claim a credit \nfor an alternative motor vehicle put into service during the tax \nyear. An alternative motor vehicle is a new qualified fuel-cell \nvehicle with at least four wheels. \nAmerican Opportunity Credit\n(line 29, Form 1040) \nFor these statistics, the American opportunity credit was \ndivided into three parts: the amount used to offset income tax \nbefore credits, the amount used to offset all other taxes, and the \nrefundable portion. (See also “Education Credits.”) \nArcher Medical Savings Account \nDeduction ∆ \n(line 23, Schedule 1) \nCertain taxpayers who were covered only by a high-\ndeductible health plan were able to participate in the Archer \nmedical savings account (MSA) program. The taxpayer was \nallowed to take a deduction of up to 65% of the $3,700 annual \ndeductible (75% of the annual $7,400 deductible for a family) \na year for contributions to a medical savings account. The \nArcher MSAs were used to pay for medical expenses not reim-\nbursable by medical insurance. Form 8853, Archer MSAs and \nLong-Term Care Insurance Contracts, was used for the MSAs. \nBasic Standard Deduction \n(included in line 12, Form 1040) \nSee “Standard Deduction.” \nBusiness or Profession Net Income Less \nLoss \nSee “Business or Profession Net Income or Loss.” \nBusiness or Profession Net Income or Loss \n(line 3, Schedule 1) \nThis source of income or loss was reported by individuals \nwho were sole proprietors of a nonfarm business, including \nself-employed members of a profession. \nIf two or more sole proprietorships were operated by the \nsame taxpayer, the single amount of net income or loss in-\ncluded in the adjusted gross income represented the combined \nnet income and loss from all sole proprietorships. The propri-\netor was required to exclude investment income from business \nprofits and include it, instead, with the various types of invest-\nment income for which separate provisions were made on the \nindividual income tax return. \nTotal expenses (line 28, Schedule C) were deducted \nfrom gross income (line 7, Schedule C) to arrive at a tenta-\ntive profit or loss. Expenses for business use of the taxpayer’s \nhome (line 30, Schedule C) were then deducted to arrive at net \nincome or loss. Starting for 2013, the IRS provided a simpli-\nfied method to determine a taxpayer’s expenses for business \nuse of a home. Under the new method, taxpayers were able to \nmultiply the area (measured in square feet) used by $5, limited \nto $1,500. Proprietor compensation was included in comput-\ning net income and not allowed as a business deduction. The \ndeduction of net operating losses from previous years was not \nconsidered a business expense but was offset against “Total \nother Income” (line 9, Schedule 1). \nCancellation of Debt \n(included in line 8c, Schedule 1) \nTaxpayers had to report any nonbusiness debt that was can-\nceled or forgiven as income on Schedule 1, line 8c. Taxpayers \nalso had to include any forgiven interest on the forgiven debt \nif the interest would not have been deductible. If the interest \nwould have been deductible, taxpayers did not have to include \nit as income. Also, a taxpayer did not have to report forgiven \ndebt as income if the forgiven amount was intended as a gift. \nCapital Assets\nSee “Sales of Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss.” \nCapital Construction Fund Reduction \n(included in line 15, Form 1040) \nThe Capital Construction Fund (CCF) is a special invest-\nment program administered by the National Marine Fisheries \nService and the IRS.

These were treated as long-term capital gains and, there-\nfore, were eligible for the reduced capital gains rates including \nthe higher 20-percent capital gains tax rate if the taxpayer’s \ntaxable income exceeded certain levels.

(See also \n“Total Itemized Deductions.”) \nCasualty or Theft Loss of Income-Producing \nProperty\n(included in line 16, Schedule A) \nThese losses were calculated using Form 4684, Casualty \nand Thefts, or Form 4797, Sales of Business Property, and then \nbrought to Schedule A. (See “Total Unlimited Miscellaneous \nDeductions.”) \nCertain Business Expenses of Reservists, \nPerforming Artists, and Fee-Basis \nGovernment Officials \n(line 12, Schedule 1) \nQualified business expenses were deductible as an adjust-\nment to income for reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis \nstate or local government officials, whether or not the taxpayer \nitemized deductions (claimed on Form 2106). \nCharitable Contributions If Took Standard \nDeduction ∆ \nThe election to claim a charitable contribution for taxpay-\ners who did not itemize their deductions expired December \n31, 2021. \nChild and Dependent Care Credit ∆\n(line 2, Schedule 3) \nThis credit could be claimed by taxpayers who, while em-\nployed or looking for work, incurred expenses for the care of \ndependent children under age 13, or disabled dependents of any \nage (claimed on Form 2441). Qualified expenses included those \nfor services performed within the home by nondependent baby-\nsitters, maids, or cooks. Expenditures to care for children under \nthe age of 13 or any other qualified individuals for out-of-home, \nnoninstitutional care qualified for the child care credit. If the \ntaxpayer omitted or used an invalid Social Security number or \nemployer identification number (EIN) for the child care pro-\nvider, the IRS used mathematical error procedures to change \nthe child care credit. \nThe changes implemented by the American Rescue Plan \nAct of 2021, enacted on March 11, 2021, were not extended. \nFor 2022, the dollar limit on qualifying expenses was $3,000 \n(previously $8,000 in 2021) for one qualifying person and \n$6,000 (previously $16,000) for two or more qualifying per-\nsons. The percentage of qualifying expenses eligible for the \ncredit was decreased from 50% to 35%, along with the income \nlimit at which the credit began phasing out, $15,000 (previously \n$125,000 for 2021). Additionally, for taxpayers who received \ndependent care benefits from their employer, the dollar limit \nof the exclusion amount decreased for 2022 to $5,000 (previ-\nously $10,500). For married employees filing separate returns, \nthe maximum amount decreased to $2,500 (previously $5,250). \nAlso, for 2022 this credit was nonrefundable whereas it was a \nrefundable credit for 2021. \nChild and Other Dependent Tax Credit ∆ \n(line 19, Form 1040) \nUnder the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the child \ntax credit had been enhanced for 2021, however those changes \nwere not extended for 2022. A child must have been under \nage 17 at the end of 2022 to be a qualifying child, down from \n18 in 2021.  To be a qualifying child, the person had to be a \nson, daughter, stepchild, adopted child, qualifying foster child, \nbrother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or descendant of any of \nthem (for example, grandchild, nephew, niece) for whom the \ntaxpayer claimed a dependent exemption. Depending on modi-\nfied AGI, a taxpayer received a credit amount of up to $2,000 \nfor a qualifying child down from $3,600 for children under 5 \nand $3,000 for those older. The amount of the child tax credit \nthat could be claimed as a refundable credit was limited as it \nwas in 2020, except the maximum additional child tax credit \namount was increased to $1,500 for each qualifying child.

Contributions could be in cash, prop-\nerty, or out-of-pocket expenses that a taxpayer paid in doing \nvolunteer work for a qualified organization. Contributions \nwere allowed as an itemized deduction on Schedule A. For \n2022, gifts by cash or check, the total amount of contribu-\ntions that a taxpayer could deduct was limited to 60% of the \ncontribution base. In 2020 and 2021, taxpayers were able to \nelect a temporary suspension of this limitation applied to cash \ncontributions,  and there was no overall limitation on item-\nized deductions. For all charitable contributions of $250 or \nmore, a written acknowledgment from the qualified recipient \norganization was required. If other than cash contributions \n(i.e., clothing, cars, stock, etc.) was $500 or more, Form 8283, \nNoncash Charitable Contributions, had to be filed to itemize \nthese. In most cases, these are limited to anywhere between \n20% to 50% of AGI according to the type of gift and recipient \nof the gift. \nTaxpayers were able to make a tax-free distribution from \nan Individual Retirement Account to certain charitable orga-\nnizations if the taxpayer was at least 70½ years old. However, \nthe taxpayer could not take a charitable deduction on Schedule \nA for the same contribution. \nCredit for Federal Tax on Gasoline and \nSpecial Fuels\n(line 12, Schedule 3) \nThis refundable credit (claimed on Form 4136) was al-\nlowed for federal excise taxes paid on gasoline and special \nfuels, such as gasohol and diesel fuel, provided the fuel was \nused for certain purposes (such as farm or nonhighway use \nin a trade or business) and bought at a price that included the \ntax, and a refund of the tax was not requested or received. The \ncredit could reduce unpaid total tax liability or be refunded. \nCredit for the Elderly or Disabled\n(line 6d, Schedule 3) \nA credit (claimed on Schedule R) for the elderly or perma-\nnently and totally disabled was available to taxpayers age 65 or \nolder (within certain income limitations), and to those taxpay-\ners under age 65 who had retired with a permanent and total \ndisability and received taxable income from a public or private \nemployer because of that disability. The income to which the \ncredit could be applied was reduced by nontaxable amounts \nof Social Security and railroad retirement benefits; veterans’ \npensions; and any other pension, annuity, or disability benefits \nexcluded from income under any other provisions of the law. \nAn individual was considered permanently and totally \ndisabled when they could not engage in any substantial gain-\nful activity because of a physical or mental condition which \nhad lasted, or was expected to last, at least 12 months, or was \ndetermined to be terminal. \nThe maximum credit available ($1,125) was limited to \ntotal income tax with any excess not refundable, and this credit \nwas reduced if the taxpayer’s income exceeded certain levels. \nGenerally, if a taxpayer’s income was high enough to require \nreporting Social Security benefits as taxable income, the tax-\npayer could not take the credit. \nCredit from Regulated Investment \nCompanies\n(line 13a, Schedule 3) \nTaxpayers were required to include in total income any \namounts which were allocated to them as undistributed long-\nterm capital gains of regulated investment companies. If in-\nvestment companies paid tax on the capital gain, taxpayers \nwere entitled to claim a refundable credit (claimed on Form \n2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-Term \nCapital Gain) for their proportionate share of the tax paid. For \nthese statistics, the credit from regulated investment compa-\nnies was divided into three parts: the amount used to offset \nincome tax before credits, the amount used to offset all other \ntaxes, and the refundable portion. \nCredit to 2023 Estimated Tax \n(line 36, Form 1040) \nThis amount was the part of the overpayment of 2022 \ntax that taxpayers specifically requested to be credited to \ntheir estimated tax for 2023. (See also “Overpayment” and \n“Estimated Tax Payments.”) \nDeductible Part of Self-Employment Tax\n(line 15, Schedule 1) \nIf a taxpayer had income from self-employment and \nowed self-employment tax, part of that tax was deductible for \nincome tax purposes. For 2022, this was equal to 50% of the \ntotal self-employment tax. The amount was subtracted as an \nadjustment to total income in the calculation of adjusted gross \nincome. (See also “Self-Employment Tax.”) \nDeductible Points \n(included on lines 8a and 8c, Schedule A) \nSee “Interest Paid Deduction.” \nDisaster Loss Deduction \n(included in line 12, Form 1040) \n315 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nExplanation of Terms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor 2022, disaster tax relief was extended for those im-\npacted by certain Presidentially declared disasters. One ben-\nefit was an increased standard deduction based on a taxpayer’s \nqualified disaster losses. If a taxpayer had a net qualified di-\nsaster loss on Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts, and was not \nitemizing their deductions, the taxpayer could have claimed an \nincreased standard deduction. (See also “Standard Deduction.”) \nDividends \n(lines 3a and 3b, Form 1040) \nOrdinary dividend income consisted of distributions of \nmoney, stock, or other property received by taxpayers from \ndomestic and foreign corporations, either directly or passed \nthrough estates, trusts, partnerships, or regulated investment \ncompanies. Ordinary dividends also included distributions \nfrom money market mutual funds. If ordinary dividends ex-\nceeded $1,500, or the taxpayer received, as a nominee, ordinary \ndividends that actually belonged to someone else, the taxpayer \nhad to fill out Schedule B to supply the details. \nOrdinary dividends did not include nontaxable distribu-\ntions of stock or stock rights, returns of capital, capital gains, \nor liquidation distributions. Taxpayers were also instructed to \nexclude amounts paid on deposits or withdrawable accounts \nin banks, mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, savings \nand loan associations, and credit unions, which were treated \nas interest income. \nQualified dividends are the ordinary dividends received \nin tax years beginning after 2002 that met certain conditions. \nThese included that the dividend must have been paid by a \nU.S. corporation or a “qualified” foreign corporation; the stock \nownership must have met certain holding period requirements; \nthe dividends were not from certain institutions, such as mutual \nsavings banks, cooperative banks, credit unions, tax-exempt \norganizations, or farmer cooperatives; and the dividends were \nnot for any share of stock that was part of an employee stock \nownership plan (ESOP). The maximum tax rate for qualified \ndividends increased 5% to 20% in 2013. Beginning in 2008, the \n5-percent tax rate for qualified dividends (generally taxpayers \nwhose other income was taxed at the 10-percent or 15-percent \nrate) was reduced to zero. Also beginning in 2013, ordinary \ndividends may have also been subject to the Net Investment \nIncome Tax of 3.8%. \nEarned Income Credit ∆ \n(line 27, Form 1040) \nThe maximum amount of the EIC increased for taxpayers \nwith at least one qualifying child, as did the amounts of earned \nincome and investment income an individual could receive and \nstill claim the credit. The maximum credit for taxpayers with \nno qualifying children fell from $1,502 to $560. For these tax-\npayers, earned income and AGI had to be less than $16,480 \n($22,610 if married filing jointly) to be eligible for the EIC. \nSpecial rules applied if claiming the EIC without a qualifying \nchild in 2021 but did not apply to 2022. For 2022, a taxpayer \ncould claim the EIC without a qualifying child if they were \nat least age 25 (up from 19 in 2021) but under age 65 (with no \nupper age limit in 2021). For taxpayers with one qualifying \nchild, the maximum credit increased from $3,618 to $3,733, \nand, for taxpayers with two qualifying children, the maximum \ncredit increased from $5,980 to $6,164. To be eligible for the \ncredit, a taxpayer’s earned income and AGI had to be less than \n$43,492 ($49,622 for married filing jointly) for one qualifying \nchild, or less than $49,399 ($55,529 for married filing jointly) \nfor two qualifying children. The maximum credit for taxpayers \nwith three or more qualifying children increased from $6,728 \nto $6,935. For these taxpayers, earned income and AGI had to \nbe less than $53,057 ($59,187 if married filing jointly) to be eli-\ngible for the EIC. The maximum amount of investment income \n(interest, dividends, and capital gain income) a taxpayer could \nhave and still claim the credit was $10,300 for the year. If a \ntaxpayer was married but didn’t file a joint return, they may \nstill have qualified to claim the EIC if they lived with a quali-\nfying child for more than half the year and lived apart from \ntheir spouse for last 6 months of 2022 or were legally separated \nunder written agreement and did not live in same household as \ntheir spouse. If two taxpayers could claim the same qualify-\ning child, the taxpayer who did not claim the child was able to \nclaim the EIC without a qualifying child. \nEarned Income Credit, Refundable Portion \nSee “Earned Income Credit and Total Refundable Credits.” \nEarned Income Credit Used To Offset Income \nTax Before Credits \nSee “Earned Income Credit and Total Refundable Credits.” \nEarned Income Credit Used To Offset Other \nTaxes \nSee “Earned Income Credit and Total Refundable Credits.” \nEducation Credits \n(line 29, Form 1040, and line 3, Schedule 3) \nThere were two education credits available, the Lifetime \nLearning credit and the American Opportunity credit. A tax-\npayer was only able to claim one of these credits per student. \nThe Lifetime Learning and American Opportunity credits were \nphased out for AGI between $80,000 and $90,000 ($160,000 \nand $180,000 for married filing jointly). A taxpayer could not \ntake any of the credits if the taxpayer was claimed as a depen-\ndent on another return or was married filing separately. \nThe Lifetime Learning credit could have been used for \ntuition and expenses for undergraduate, graduate, and profes-\nsional degree courses. The credit could have been taken for an \nunlimited amount of time, as long as the taxpayer or depen-\ndents were enrolled in postsecondary education. The Lifetime \nLearning credit was a maximum of 20% of the first $10,000 of \neligible expenses, or $2,000 per return. \n316 \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe American Opportunity credit could have been used \nfor tuition and expenses for an undergraduate or other recog-\nnized education credential. The credit could only have been \nused for the first 4 years of postsecondary education, as long \nas the taxpayer or dependents were enrolled at least half time. \nThe maximum credit per student was $2,500 (100% of the \nfirst $2,000 and 25% of the next $2,000 of qualified education \nexpenses). The credit was available for the first 4 years of post-\nsecondary education, and 40% of the credit (up to $1,000) was \nrefundable. (See also “American Opportunity Credit.”) Both \nof these credits were calculated using Form 8863, Education \nCredits. \nEducation IRA (Coverdell Education Savings \nAccounts)\nTaxpayers could have made nondeductible contribu-\ntions up to $2,000 annually to an educational IRA for a child \nunder age 18. The earnings and withdrawals were tax-free to \nthe extent that withdrawals did not exceed the beneficiary’s \nqualified higher education expenses for the year. The edu-\ncational IRA contribution was phased out for modified ad-\njusted gross income between $95,000 and $110,000 (between \n$190,000 and $220,000 for taxpayers married filing jointly). \n(See also “Individual Retirement Arrangement (Deductible) \nPayments.”) \nEducator Expenses Deduction\n(line 11, Schedule 1) \nIf a taxpayer was an eligible educator in kindergarten \nthrough grade 12 in 2022, a deduction of $250 ($500 for two \neducators filing jointly) of qualified expenses could have been \ntaken, even if the taxpayer did not itemize deductions. \nEmployee Business Expense \nSee “Certain Business Expenses of Reservists, Performing \nArtists, and Fee-Basis Government Officials.” \nEmployer-Provided Adoption Benefits from \nForm 8839 ∆ \n(line 1f, Form 1040) \nTotal employer-provided adoption benefits from Form \n8839.  The taxpayer was also able to exclude amounts of total \nemployer-provided benefits shown on Form(s) W-2 if the ad-\nopted child had special needs and the adoption became final \nin 2022. \nEstate and Trust Net Income Less Loss \nSee “Estate and Trust Net Income or Loss.” \nEstate and Trust Net Income or Loss \n(line 37, Schedule E, Part III) \nThis was the beneficiary’s share of fiduciary income \n(with the exception of the items described below, which were \nreported separately) from any estate or trust. Income from \nestates or trusts included amounts required to be distributed; \namounts credited to beneficiaries’ accounts from current-year \nfiduciary income (whether or not actually distributed); and any \nother amounts which were properly paid, credited, or required \nto be distributed for that year. \nTaxpayers excluded their share of dividends and gains \nor losses from sales of capital assets or other property from \nestate or trust income. Such income (which usually makes up \nthe largest portion of income from estates or trusts) was in-\ncluded on the tax return on the separate lines provided for \nthese income types and was not separately identified for the \nstatistics. A loss from an estate or trust was allocated to the \nbeneficiary only upon settlement or termination of an estate or \ntrust and was limited by the “passive loss” rules. \nThe columns labeled “net income” and “net loss” repre-\nsent the sum of all income and losses reported from all estates \nor trusts, i.e., the net amount computed on a return-by-return \nbasis. \nEstimated Tax Payments \n(line 26, Form 1040) \nThis figure represents the total tax payments made for \n2022 using Form 1040-ES, and any overpayment from the \ntaxpayer’s 2021 return that was applied to the 2022 estimated \ntax. Generally, individuals were required to make estimated \ntax payments if they expected to owe, after subtracting with-\nholding and credits, at least $1,000 in tax for 2022, and if they \nexpected withholding and credits to be less than the smaller \nof (a) 90% of the tax shown on Form 1040 for 2022, or (b) \n100% of the tax shown on Form 1040 for 2021 (110% of the \ntax shown on Form 1040 for 2021 for taxpayers who are not \nfarmers nor fishermen with adjusted gross income greater than \n$150,000 ($75,000 for married filing separately)). \nExcess Advance Premium Tax Credit \nRepayment  \n(line 2, Schedule 2) \nBeginning in 2014, a taxpayer may have been eligible for \nthe premium tax credit if they, their spouse, or a dependent \nenrolled in health insurance through the Health Insurance \nMarketplace. The premium tax credit was used to help pay \nfor this health insurance. The taxpayer may have elected to \nhave all or part of the credit paid in advance, during the year, \nto the insurer. Advance payments were based on an estimate of \nthe taxpayer’s income and family size for the coverage year. If \nadvance payments of this credit were more than the premium \ntax credit a taxpayer could claim, the excess amount, subject \nto certain limitations based on household income and filing \nstatus, was reported here. This was calculated using Form \n8962, Premium Tax Credit. For these statistics, this amount \nwas excluded from “total income tax” and included instead \nin “all other taxes.” (See also “Advance Payment of Premium \nTax Credit,” “Net Premium Tax Credit,” “Total Premium Tax \nCredit,” “Total Income Tax,” and “All Other Taxes.”) \n317 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nExplanation of Terms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExcess Social Security Taxes Withheld ∆\n(line 11, Schedule 3) \nIf a taxpayer earned more than $147,000 in total wages \nfrom two or more employers in 2022, too much Social Security \n(FICA) or Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) tax may have \nbeen withheld from his or her wages. (There was no wage base \nlimitation for Medicare tax; therefore, all covered wages were \nsubject to Medicare tax.) Filers claimed credit for such over-\npayment on their income tax returns. Excess FICA or RRTA \ntax withheld could be taken as a credit toward payment of the \ntaxpayer’s income tax or be refunded. In the case of a joint \nreturn, the credit was computed separately for each taxpayer. \nFarm Net Income or Loss \n(line 6, Schedule 1) \nThis source of income or loss was reported by individuals \nwho were sole proprietors of farms. When there were two or \nmore farms operated by the same taxpayer, the single amount \nof profit or loss included in the adjusted gross income repre-\nsented the combined profit and loss from all farming activi-\nties. Farm business total expenses (line 33, Schedule F) were \ndeducted from farm gross income (line 9, Schedule F) to arrive \nat farm net profit or loss. \nGains from certain sales of livestock and crops that quali-\nfied for capital gains treatment were excluded from farm net \nprofit or loss and included in capital gains. Farm rental income \nwas included in total rental net income or loss. (See also “Farm \nRental Net Income or Loss.”) \nFarm Rental Net Income Less Loss \nSee “Farm Rental Net Income or Loss.” \nFarm Rental Net Income or Loss \n(line 40, Schedule E) \nTaxpayers were required to report farm rental income and \nexpenses separately from other farm profit or loss if they (a) \nreceived income based on crops or livestock produced by the \ntenant, and (b) did not manage or operate the farm to any great \nextent. These income and expenses were reported on Form \n4835, with net income less loss then reported on Schedule E. \n(See also “Total Rental and Royalty Income or Loss.”) \nFiling Status\nSee “Marital Filing Status.” \nFirst-Time Homebuyer Credit Repayment \n(line 10, Schedule 2) \nTaxpayers claiming the first-time homebuyer credit for a \nhome bought in 2008 generally had to begin repaying it on \ntheir 2010 return. In addition, taxpayers generally must repay \nany credit claimed for a home bought after 2008 if the taxpayer \ndisposed of the home, or it ceased to be their main home during \nthe 36-month period that began on the purchase date. \nForeign-Earned Income Exclusion ∆\n(line 8d, Schedule 1) \nQualified taxpayers could exclude from total income a cer-\ntain amount of foreign-earned income and employer-provided \nforeign housing expenses if their home, for tax purposes, was \nin a foreign country (claimed on Forms 2555). Taxpayers had to \nrefigure their tax using the foreign-earned income worksheet. \nThe refigured tax was based on non-excluded income using the \ntax tables that would have applied had the taxpayer not claimed \nthe exclusion. Beginning in 2019, all taxpayers had to claim the \nforeign income exclusion on Form 2555. Furthermore, Form \n2555-EZ was no longer available to make the exclusion of for-\neign-earned income and foreign housing cost amount. \nQualifying individuals were limited to the lesser of a \n$112,000 exclusion or their total foreign-earned income. Also, \nthey could elect to exclude a portion of employer-provided for-\neign housing expenses. If the taxpayer elected to take both \nthe foreign-earned income and foreign housing exclusions, the \ntotal amount of both exclusions was limited to the taxpayer’s \ntotal foreign-earned income. The employer-provided foreign \nhousing exclusion was left as part of other income. (See also \n“Other Net Income or Net Loss.”) \nForeign Housing Deduction ∆\n(line 24j, Schedule 1) \nQualified taxpayers who had foreign housing expenses that \nwere not provided by their employer were eligible to deduct \nthese expenses from total income (claimed on Form 2555). This \ndeduction was limited to $33,600, with exceptions based on the \nlocation of the foreign housing. This deduction, together with \nthe foreign-earned income exclusion, was limited to the total \namount of foreign-earned income for 2022. \nForeign Tax Credit\n(line 1, Schedule 3) \nIndividuals who paid income or excess profit taxes to a \nforeign country or U.S. possession could either claim this credit \nagainst federal income tax liability or take an itemized deduc-\ntion for the amount of the foreign tax payment. Depending on \nthe taxpayer’s income and taxes, the foreign tax credit could \nbe less than the amount of foreign tax paid. Qualifying foreign \ntaxes paid in excess of the allowable amount for Tax Year 2022 \ncould be carried back 1 year and then forward 10 years. If \nthis credit was more than $300 ($600 for married filing a joint \nreturn), the taxpayer had to file Form 1116 to get this credit. \nForm 8814 \nSee “Parents’ Election To Report Child’s Interest and \nDividends.” \nForms 1040 and 1040-SR ∆ \nThe individual income tax system utilizes Form 1040 to \ncollect income and tax information.

Gambling \nlosses were not allowed to offset winnings on line 8b. Instead, \ngambling losses were an itemized deduction reported on \nSchedule A. (See also “Gambling Loss Deduction” and “Other \nNet Income or Net Loss.”) \nGambling Loss Deduction \n(included in line 16, Schedule A) \nGambling losses (to the extent of gambling winnings) \nwere fully deductible for taxpayers who itemized deductions. \n(See also “Gambling Earnings,” “Total Itemized Deductions,” \nand “Total Unlimited Miscellaneous Deductions.”) \nGeneral Business Credit \n(line 6a, Schedule 3) \nThe general business credit consists of the: \n•  investment credit; \n•  advanced manufacturing production credit; \n•  research credit; \n•  low-income housing credit (carryforward only); \n•  disable access credit; \n•  renewable electricity, clean hydrogen, refined coal, \nIndian coal production credit; \n• Indian employment credit;  \n• orphan drug credit;  \n•  new markets credit; \n•  small employer pension plan startup credit; \n•  employer-provided child care facilities and services \ncredit; \n•  biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit; \n•  low-sulfur diesel fuel production credit; \n•  distilled spirits credit; \n•  nonconventional source fuel credit (carryforward only); \n•  energy-efficient home credit; \n•  energy-efficient appliance credit (carryforward only); \n•  alternative motor vehicle credit; \n•  alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit; \n•  enhanced oil recovery credit; \n•  mine rescue team training credit; \n•  agricultural chemicals security credit (carryforward \nonly); \n•  credit for employer differential wage payments; \n•  carbon dioxide sequestration credit; \n•  qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle credit; \n•  qualified plug-in electric vehicle credit (carryforward \nonly); \n•  employee retention credit; \n•  new hire retention credit (carryforward only); \n•  credit from electing large partnerships (carryforward \nonly); and \n• oil and gas production from marginal wells credit. \nTaxpayers claiming more than one of these credits were \nrequired to summarize them on Form 3800, General Business \nCredit. The general business credit was limited to 100% of the \nfirst $25,000 ($12,500 for a married couple filing separately) \nof tax liability, and 25% of the excess over $25,000. If the \ncurrent-year general business credit exceeded the tax liability \nlimitation, the excess amount could be carried back to the \npreceding tax year, then forward 20 years. \nStarting in 2008, the general business credit was ex-\npanded to accommodate certain general business credits al-\nlowed against the alternative minimum tax (AMT). These \ncredits consisted of the: \n•  empowerment zone employment credit;        \n•  investment credit; \n•  work opportunity credit; \n•  alcohol and cellulosic biofuel fuels credit; \n•  low-income housing credit; \n•  renewable electricity, refined coal, and Indian coal pro-\nduction credit; \n•  credit for employer Social Security and Medicare taxes \npaid on certain employee tips; \n•  qualified railroad track maintenance credit; \n•  credit for small employer health insurance premiums; \n•  credit for increasing research activities; and \n• employer credit for paid family and medical leave. \nStarting in 2010, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 al-\nlowed general business credits for eligible small businesses to \noffset both the regular tax and AMT. Such eligible small busi-\nness credits determined for the first tax year in 2010 are carried \nback 5 years. For purposes of the statistics in this publication, \nan eligible small business is a sole proprietorship with average \ngross receipts (reduced by returns and allowances) of less than \n$50 million for the 3-tax-year period preceding the tax year of \nthe credits. For 2013 and forward, taxpayers could only take \ncarryforwards of these eligible small business credits. \nGeneral Sales Tax Deduction \nSee “Sales Tax Deduction.” \nGlobal Intangible Low-Taxed Income Amount\n(line 8o, Schedule 1) \n319 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nExplanation of Terms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA taxpayer who was a U.S. shareholder (including a part-\nner of a domestic partnership) and who owned stock in one or \nmore controlled foreign corporations had to include certain \nportions of their global intangible low-taxed income in gross \nincome. This amount was calculated on Form 8992 and brought \nto line 8n on Schedule 1. \nHealth Coverage Tax Credit (formerly Health \nInsurance Credit) ∆\nThe health coverage tax credit was not extended and was \nnot available after 2021. \nHealth Savings Account Deduction ∆\n(line 13, Schedule 1) \nA deduction for contributions to a health savings account \n(HSA) was limited to $3,650, or $7,300 for family coverage \n(claimed on Form 8889). These limits were $1,000 higher if the \ntaxpayer was age 55 or older. A taxpayer could not contribute \nto an HSA starting the first month that they were enrolled in \nMedicare. A taxpayer was able to exclude from income a quali-\nfied funding distribution made from an IRA to an HSA. This \nwas a one-time distribution made directly by the trustee of the \ntaxpayer’s IRA to the HSA. In addition, an employer was able \nto make a rollover contribution to an employee’s HSA from a \nqualified health flexible spending arrangement or a qualified \nhealth reimbursable arrangement. \nHome Mortgage Interest Deduction \n(lines 8a+8b, Schedule A) \nThe total home mortgage interest deduction consists of \ninterest paid to financial institutions on Schedule A, line 8a, \nand interest paid to individuals on line 8b, Schedule A. (See \nalso “Interest Paid Deduction.”) \nHome Mortgage Interest Paid to Financial \nInstitutions \n(line 8a, Schedule A) \nSee “Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.” \nHome Mortgage Interest Paid to Individuals\n(line 8b, Schedule A) \nSee “Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.” \nHousehold Employee Wages Not Reported \non Form W-2 ∆ \n(line 1b, Form 1040) \nTotal wages a taxpayer received as a household employee \nthat was not reported on Form(s) W-2. An employer wasn’t \nrequired to provide a Form W-2 if wages were less than $2,400 \nin 2022. \nHousehold Employment Tax ∆\n(line 9, Schedule 2) \nTaxpayers paying domestic employees more than $2,400 \nannually generally had to pay Social Security, Medicare, and \nfederal unemployment taxes (if the pay was $1,000 or more \nfor any quarter) for these employees by filing Schedule H, \nHousehold Employment Taxes, with their income tax return. \nFor 2022, the rate of Social Security tax on taxable wages, \nincluding sick leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before \nOctober 1, 2021, was 6.2% each for the employer and employee \nor 12.4% for both.  Qualified sick leave wages and qualified \nfamily leave wages for leave taken before April 1, 2021 and \nafter March 30, 2020, were subject to the employer share of \nSocial Security tax; therefore, the tax rate on those wages was \n6.2%. The Medicare tax rate was 1.45% each. Beginning in \n2013, taxpayers had to withhold a 0.9% Additional Medicare \nTax from wages they paid to an employee in excess of $200,000 \nin a calendar year. The Additional Medicare Tax was only im-\nposed on the employee. \nIncome From Form 8853 ∆ \n(line 8e, Schedule 1) \nIncluded income taxpayer had from Form 8853, lines 8, \n12, and 26. \nIncome Subject to Tax \nSee “Modified Taxable Income.” \nIncome Tax After Credits ∆ \n(line 18, Form 1040, minus part or all of lines 19, 20, 27, 28, \nand 29, minus Form 1040, Schedule 2, line 2, minus Form 1040, \nSchedule 3, lines 9, 13a, 13b, and 13h) \nTo arrive at income tax after credits, taxpayers deducted \ntotal credits (lines 19 and 20, Form 1040) from income tax \nbefore credits (line 18, Form 1040). For these statistics, tax \nwas further reduced by the excess advance premium tax credit \nrepayment (line 2, Schedule 2) and the portion of the earned \nincome credit (EIC) (line 27, Form 1040), additional child tax \ncredit (line 28, Form 1040), American opportunity credit (line \n29, Form 1040), net premium tax credit (line 9, Schedule 3), \nregulated investment company credit (line 13a, Schedule 3), \nand qualified sick and family leave credits (lines 13b and 13h, \nSchedule 3), which did not result in a negative tax. These por-\ntions of the EIC, American opportunity credit, net premium tax \ncredit, and regulated investment company credit, were included \nin the total refundable credits used to offset income tax before \ncredits. Any tax remaining after subtraction of all credits, in-\ncluding the credits mentioned above, was tabulated as “income \ntax after credits.” \nIncome Tax Before Credits \n(line 18, Form 1040) \nIn this report, this amount consisted of the tax liability \non taxable income, computed by using the tax tables, tax rate \nschedules, Schedule D tax worksheet, foreign-earned income \nworksheet, Schedule J, Income Averaging for Farmers and \n320 \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFishermen, or Form 8615, plus Form(s) 8814 (line 16 (1), Form \n1040), any additional taxes from Form 4972 (line 16(2), Form \n1040), 962 election (line 16(3), Form 1040), the alternative \nminimum tax (line 1, Schedule 2), and the excess advance \npremium tax credit repayment (line 2, Schedule 2).

Taxpayers should \nattach the form to their return. \nIncome Tax Withheld from W-2 \n(line 25a, Form 1040) \n“Income tax withheld from W-2” included amounts de-\nducted from salaries, wages, and tips, as reported on Form \nW-2. \nIndividual Retirement Arrangement\n(Deductible) Payments ∆\n(line 20, Schedule 1) \nAn individual retirement arrangement (IRA) is a savings \nprogram that generally allows a taxpayer to set aside money \nfor retirement. In addition to the traditional IRA, there were \ntwo other plans available: the education IRA and the Roth \nIRA. Information on these two IRAs can be found under their \nseparate headings. \nTaxpayers not covered by an employment retirement plan \nmay have been able to deduct all contributions to a traditional \nIRA. For taxpayers covered by a retirement plan at work, the \ntraditional IRA deduction phased out between $109,000 and \n$129,000 of modified adjusted gross income (AGI) for married \npersons filing jointly and surviving spouses; between $68,000 \nand $78,000 for single filers, heads of households, or married \nfiling separately taxpayers living apart; and between $0 and \n$10,000 for married filing separately taxpayers living together. \nIf one spouse was an active participant in an employer plan \nbut the other was not, the deduction for the IRA contribution \nof the spouse not covered by an employer plan phased out \nbetween modified AGI of $204,000 and $214,000. Deductible \ncontributions could be subtracted from the employee’s total \nincome in arriving at AGI. \nContributions to an IRA (whether or not they were deduct-\nible) were limited to the lesser of (a) the individual’s taxable \ncompensation for the year, or (b) $6,000 ($7,000, if age 50 \nor older). Married couples filing a joint return could contrib-\nute up to $6,000 ($7,000, if age 50 or older) to each spouse’s \nIRA, even if one spouse had minimal or no compensation. \nTherefore, the total combined IRA contributions could be up \nto $12,000 ($14,000, if age 50 or older) for a year. \nUnless they were disabled or affected by COVID-19 (the \nlatter provision was added in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and \nEconomic Security Act (CARES Act)), taxpayers could not \nstart withdrawing funds from the traditional IRA account until \nthey reached age 59½. After age 72, taxpayers were required \nto begin withdrawals. The age 72 requirement was increased \nfrom 70½ by the Secure Act enacted on December 20, 2019. \nPenalty taxes were assessed if the taxpayer failed to comply \nwith these limitations. The additional tax on early withdrawals \nfrom a traditional IRA was eliminated if the distributions were \nused for qualified higher education expenses. This additional \ntax was also eliminated on distributions up to $10,000 from \ntraditional or Roth IRAs if the distributions were used to buy, \nbuild, or rebuild a qualified first home. Beginning for 2021, \nthe additional tax on early distributions didn’t apply to quali-\nfied disaster distributions, including 2020 coronavirus-related \ndistributions. A taxpayer was able to exclude from income a \nqualified funding distribution made from an IRA to a health \nsavings account. Payments to an IRA for a particular tax-\nable year had to be made no later than the due date of the \nindividual’s return for that year. (See also “Roth IRA” and \n“Education IRA.”) \nIndividual Retirement Arrangement Taxable \nDistributions \n(line 4b, Form 1040) \nStarting in 2019, the Individual Retirement Arrangement \nand pensions and annuities were separated into different lines \non Form 1040 as in Tax Year 2017 and prior. In 2018, the \nIndividual Retirement Arrangement and pensions and an-\nnuities were combined into one line. Any money or property \nreceived from a taxpayer’s IRA account was considered a dis-\ntribution and, generally, had to be included in the taxpayer’s \n321 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nExplanation of Terms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntotal income in the year received. Exempted from this rule were \ntax-free roll-over distributions from one retirement account to \nanother, distributions where the payout represented previously \ntaxed nondeductible IRA contributions, distributions from a \nRoth IRA, distributions made to the taxpayer’s health savings \naccount, and distributions from an IRA made directly by the \ntrustee to a qualified charitable organization if the taxpayer \nwas at least 72 when the distribution was made. If a taxpayer \nconverted from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, the taxpayer \nwas required to include in gross income the amount that would \nhave been reported in income if a withdrawal from this IRA \nhad been made. The taxpayer did not include in gross income \nany part of the conversion that was a nondeductible contribu-\ntion in a traditional IRA. \nStarting in 2010, the $100,000 modified adjusted gross \nincome limit on rollovers and conversions from eligible re-\ntirement plans to Roth IRAs was eliminated. Also, married \ntaxpayers filing separately were allowed to roll over or convert \namounts to a Roth IRA. \nInterest on Deferred Tax on Gain from Certain \nInstallment Sales \n(line 15, Schedule 2) \nInterest on the deferred tax on gain from certain install-\nment sales with a sales price that was over $150,000 under \nsection 453A(c). \nInterest Paid Deduction ∆ \n(line 10, Schedule A, including lines 8e and 9) \nThe rules for deducting home mortgage interest for 2022 \nwere that (1) if a taxpayer took out a mortgage before October \n13, 1987, secured by the taxpayer’s main or second home, all \nthe interest was deductible; (2) if the taxpayer’s mortgage was \nafter October 13, 1987, and the funds were used to buy, build, \nor improve that home, all interest could be deducted if the total \nof all mortgages on the property was $750,000 or less ($375,000 \nfor married filing separately); and (3) taxpayers could no longer \ndeduct any of the interest on home equity loans  on their main \nor second home other than to buy, build, or improve that home. \nGenerally, investment interest (interest paid on money bor-\nrowed that is allocable to property held for investment) was \nfully deductible up to the amount of net investment income. \nBeginning in 1993, the net investment income that was to be \ncompared to investment interest could not include any net capi-\ntal gains or qualified dividends that were taxed on the capital \ngains tax rates. Interest relating to business, royalty, and rental \nincome was deducted directly from these items and was not \nreflected in the interest paid statistics. \nTaxpayers could include in interest deductible points, \nwhich were points not reported on Form 1098.However, for \n2022, taxpayers could no longer deduct mortgage insurance \npremiums for mortgage insurance contracts. \nInterest Received \nSee “Taxable Interest Received.” \nInterest, Tax-Exempt \nSee “Tax-Exempt Interest.” \nInvestment Interest Expense Deduction \n(line 9, Schedule A) \nSee “Interest Paid Deduction” and “Total Itemized \nDeductions.” \nItemized Deductions \nSee “Total Itemized Deductions” and specific itemized \ndeductions. \nLimitation on Business Losses ∆ \n(line 8p, Schedule 1) \nTaxpayers had their business losses limited to their total \ngross income and gains attributable to those trades or busi-\nnesses plus $270,000 (or $540,000 in the case of a joint return). \nThe excess amount was reported as other income on Form \n1040, Schedule 1, and could be treated as net operating loss \nfor the following tax year. This limitation was calculated on \nForm 461. \nLimited State and Local Taxes \n(line 5e, Schedule A) \nThe deduction for State and local income, sales, and \nproperty taxes was limited to a combined, total deduction of \n$10,000 ($5,000 for married filing separately). \nLong-Term Loss Carryover\n(line 14, Schedule D) \nLong-term capital losses from the prior-year Schedule D \nthat are not included in taxable income are carried over to the \ncurrent year. (See “Sales of Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss.”) \nMarginal Tax Rates\n“Marginal tax rate” as cited in this publication is the high-\nest statutory rate on taxable income. It includes ordinary tax \nrates and capital gains tax rates. This concept does not include \nthe effects of alternative minimum tax, Net Investment Income \nTax, or tax credits. Also, for some taxpayers, the statutory mar-\nginal tax rate may differ from the effective marginal tax rate. \nFor example, extra income received by certain taxpayers re-\nsulted in the phase-out of deductions and credits (i.e., student \nloan interest deduction, education credit, etc.). Therefore, an \nextra $1 of income could have added more than $1 of taxable \nincome. While this taxpayer could face a statutory marginal tax \nrate of 37.0%, the effective marginal rate faced by the taxpayer \nwould be somewhat higher.

The exception was that, if a spouse died \nduring the tax year, the surviving spouse was considered mar-\nried for the entire year. If a taxpayer was divorced during the \ntax year and did not remarry, the taxpayer was considered to \nbe unmarried for the entire year. Surviving spouse status could \nonly be used by those taxpayers with a qualifying dependent \nwhose spouse died in 2020 or 2021. Starting in 2013, if a tax-\npayer had a same-sex spouse and had been legally married in \na State (or foreign country), the taxpayer and his or her spouse \ngenerally had to use the married filing jointly or married filing \nseparately filing status. \nMedical and Dental Expenses\n(line 1, Schedule A) \nSee “Medical and Dental Expenses Deduction.” \nMedical and Dental Expenses Deduction \n(lines 1-4, Schedule A) \nQualified medical expenses included non-reimbursed \npayments made for the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of \ndisease, or for medical or dental insurance. However, taxpay-\ners who took the self-employed health insurance adjustment \nhad to reduce their total premium deduction by the amount \nof the adjustment (see “Self-Employed Health Insurance”). \nIn general, medical and dental expenses could be claimed as \nan itemized deduction to the extent that they exceeded 7.5% \nof adjusted gross income in 2022. Amounts paid for medi-\ncine and drugs were deductible only if they were available by \nprescription only, or they were for insulin. Taxpayers could \ndeduct costs for transportation to obtain medical care, and \nalso a maximum of $50 per day for certain lodging expenses \nincurred while traveling to obtain medical care. Capture of \ndata for these lines was limited to those taxpayers that had a \nvalue on line 4, medical and dental expenses deduction. (See \nalso “Total Itemized Deductions.”) \nMedical and Dental Expenses Limitation\n(line 3, Schedule A) \nThis was equal to 7.5% of adjusted gross income. (See \n“Medical and Dental Expenses Deduction” and “Total \nItemized Deductions.”) \nMedical Savings Account Deduction\nSee “Archer Medical Savings Account Deduction.” \nMinimum Tax Credit \n(line 6b, Schedule 3) \nSee “Prior-Year Minimum Tax Credit.” \nMiscellaneous Deductions Other Than \nGambling\n(included in line 16, Schedule A) \nOther fully deductible expenses included such items as \nimpairment-related work expenses for disabled persons, and \namortizable bonds. (See also “Total Unlimited Miscellaneous \nDeductions” and “Total Itemized Deductions.”) \nModified Taxable Income \n“Modified taxable income” is the term used to describe \n“income subject to tax,” the actual base on which tax is com-\nputed for the statistics in Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. For most \ntaxpayers filing current-year returns, modified taxable income \nis identical to “taxable income.” For those returns with a \nForm 8814, Parents’ Election To Report Child’s Interest and \nDividends, attached, modified taxable income includes the \nsum of all children’s interest and dividend income taxed at a \n10-percent rate, as well as the parent’s taxable income. \nFor prior-year returns included in the 2022 statistics, a \nmodified taxable income was calculated by using the tax rate \nschedule for 2022 to impute a hypothetical taxable income \namount necessary to yield the given amount of tax reported. \nThe same was done for returns that used the foreign-earned \nincome worksheet, Schedule J, Income Averaging for Farmers \nand Fishermen, 962 election, or had any tax from repatriated \n(Section 965) income deferred to other tax years when report-\ning income tax before credits. In most cases, a person who had \nno tax will have no modified taxable income. Since the tax rate \nschedule is used to generate the modified taxable income, it \nis possible for a person to have up to $4 of taxable income but \nhave no modified taxable income, because the tax reported \nwould be zero. The exception is for certain taxpayers who only \nhave income taxed at the long-term capital gains rates, and that \nincome is less than the cutoff for the beginning of the 22-per-\ncent tax bracket. In this case, the taxpayer would have no tax \nand would have modified taxable income that was taxed at 0%. \nMortgage Insurance Premiums  ∆ \nThe election to deduct qualified mortgage insurance pre-\nmiums didn’t apply for tax years beginning after December \n31, 2021. \nMortgage Interest Credit\n(line 6g, Schedule 3) \nTaxpayers could claim this credit only if they were issued \na qualified Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) by a State or \n323 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nExplanation of Terms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlocal governmental unit.

The NIIT is 3.8% of the \nsmaller of a taxpayer’s net investment income or the excess of \na taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income over $200,000 for \nsingle or head of household ($250,000 for married filing jointly \nor qualifying widow(er), or $125,000 for married filing sepa-\nrately). For these statistics, the NIIT was excluded from “All \nOther Taxes” and instead included in “Total Income Tax.” The \nNIIT was calculated on Form 8960, Net Investment Income \nTax—Individuals, Estates, and Trusts. \nNet Long-Term Adjustment\n(lines 8b(g)-10(g), Schedule D) \nSee “Sales of Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss”; see also \n“Net Long-Term Capital Gain or Loss from Sales of Capital \nAssets.” \nNet Long-Term Capital Gain or Loss\n(line 15, Schedule D) \nThis includes gain or loss from sales of capital assets, gain \nor loss from other forms, gain or loss from a partnership/S cor-\nporation, estates and a trust held more than 1 year, and capital \ngain distributions less any long-term loss carryover.

Starting in 2013, taxpayers could combine certain trans-\nactions on line 8a of Schedule D without completing Form \n8949. Taxpayers must have received a Form 1099-B that shows \nbasis was reported to the IRS and does not show a nondeduct-\nible wash sale loss in box 5, and the taxpayers did not need \nto make any adjustments to the basis or type of gain or loss \nreported on Form 1099-B or to their gain or loss. For all other \ntransactions not summarized on line 8a, taxpayers had to report \nthese on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital \nAssets, separated into three categories: transactions reported \non Form 1099-B with basis reported to the IRS, transactions \nreported on Form 1099-B but with basis not reported to the \nIRS, or transactions without a Form 1099-B. In addition to \nthese three categories, taxpayers had to report the transactions’ \nnet long-term sales price, cost or basis and adjustments to gain \nor loss on lines 8b through 10 of Schedule D. (See “Sales of \nCapital Assets, Net Gain or Loss”; see also “Net Long-Term \nCapital Gain or Loss.”) \nNet Long-Term Sales Price\n(lines 8a(d)-10(d), Schedule D) \nSee “Sales of Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss”; see also \n“Net Long-Term Capital Gain or Loss from Sales of Capital \nAssets.” \nNet Operating Loss\n(line 8a, Schedule 1) \n“Net operating loss” was the excess loss of a business when \ntaxable income for a prior year was less than zero. The loss \ncould be applied to the adjusted gross income for the current \nyear and carried forward up to 20 years. (See also “Other Net \nIncome or Net Loss.”) \nNet Premium Tax Credit \n(line 9, Schedule 3) \nBeginning in 2014, a taxpayer may have been eligible for \nthe premium tax credit if they, their spouse, or a dependent \nenrolled in health insurance through the Health Insurance \nMarketplace. The premium tax credit was used to help pay \nfor this health insurance. The American Rescue Plan Act of \n2021, passed on March 11, 2021, expanded the PTC by elimi-\nnating the limitation that a taxpayer’s household income may \nnot exceed 400% of the Federal Poverty Line and generally \nincreased the credit amounts. In addition, in 2021, if a taxpayer \nreceived unemployment compensation, they were generally eli-\ngible to claim the PTC if they met the other requirements. If \nthe total premium tax credit that a taxpayer was eligible for \nwas greater than the advance payments of the premium tax \ncredit that the taxpayer had already received, then the taxpayer \nclaimed the difference as a net premium (refundable) tax credit. \n324 \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIf advance payments of the premium tax credit were more than \nthe premium tax credit the taxpayer could claim, the taxpayer \nhad to pay an excess advance premium tax credit repayment. \nThese calculations were made using Form 8962, Premium Tax \nCredit.

However, any employer-provided \nforeign housing exclusions were included in other income (as a \nnegative amount).Also, nontaxable Medicaid waiver payments \nincluded on wages lines 1a or 1d were also enteredaa as a nega-\ntive amount on line 8s. \nOther Payments\n(line 13z, Schedule 3) \n“Other payments” is a residual category included in the \ntotal of “tax payments,” but not shown separately. (See also \n“Tax Payments,”) \nOther Tax Credits \n(line 6z, Schedule 3) \n“Other tax credits” is a residual category in the statistics. \nIt includes other miscellaneous credits that did not belong in \nany other category and were used to offset income tax before \ncredits. \nOther Taxes \n(line 17z, Schedule 2) \nSee “All Other Taxes.” \nOther Taxes Deduction \n(line 6, Schedule A) \n“Other taxes” consisted of any deductible tax other than \nState and local income taxes, real estate taxes, and personal \nproperty taxes. One example is taxes paid to a foreign country \nor U.S. possession. (See also “Taxes Paid Deduction.”) \nOther Than Cash Contributions \n(line 12, Schedule A) \nSee “Contributions Deduction.” \nOverpayment\n(line 34, Form 1040) \nAn overpayment of tax occurred when “total tax pay-\nments” exceeded “total tax.” Overpayments included the \namount of any “refundable portion” of the refundable credits. \nAn overpayment could be refunded or credited toward the es-\ntimated tax for the following year. (See also “Credit to 2023 \nEstimated Tax” and “Refund.”) \nOverpayment Refunded\n(line 35a, Form 1040) \nSee “Overpayment” and “Refund.” \nParents’ Election To Report Child’s Interest \nand Dividends ∆ \n(calculated on Form 8814) \nA parent could elect to report on his or her return income \nreceived by his or her child. If the election was made, the child \nwas not required to file a return. A parent could make this \nelection if the child: \n•  was under age 19 (or under 24 if full-time student) at \nthe end of 2022; \n•  had income only from interest and dividends, includ-\ning Alaska permanent fund dividends and capital gain \ndistributions; \n•  had gross income for 2022 that was less than $11,500; \n•  did not file a joint return; \n•  had no estimated tax payments for 2022; \n•  did not have any overpayment of tax shown on his or her \n2021 return applied to the 2022 return; and \n•  had no federal income tax withheld from his or her \nincome (backup withholding). \nIf the parents were not filing a joint return, special rules \napplied to determine which parent could make the election. \n326 \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(See also “Modified Taxable Income,” “Income Tax Before \nCredits,” and “Other Net Income or Net Loss.”) \nPartnership and S Corporation Net Income \nLess Loss \nSee “Partnership and S Corporation Net Income or Loss.” \nPartnership and S Corporation Net Income \nor Loss \n(line 32, Schedule E) \nPartnerships and S Corporations (formerly Subchapter S \nCorporations) are not taxable entities; therefore, tax on their \nnet profit or loss was levied, in general, directly on the mem-\nbers of the partnership or shareholders of the S Corporation. \nThe profit or loss shown in the statistics was the taxpayer’s \nshare of the ordinary gain or loss of the enterprise, and cer-\ntain payments made to the taxpayer for the use of capital or, \nfor partnerships, as salary. Net long-term capital gains re-\nceived from partnerships and S Corporations were reported \non Schedule D. \nIf a return showed net income from one partnership or S \nCorporation and a net loss from another, the two were added \ntogether, and the return was tabulated by the net amount of \nincome or loss in the appropriate column. Beginning in 1987, \nnet income and net loss were reported separately for passive \nand nonpassive partnership and S Corporation activities. \nPassive losses were limited to the amount that could offset \npassive income. \nPassive Activity Losses\nLosses generated by any “flow-through” business activ-\nity (such as partnerships or S Corporations for which profits \nand certain other amounts were passed directly through to the \nowners), in which the taxpayer did not “materially participate” \n(i.e., was not involved regularly and substantially in the opera-\ntions of the activity), qualified as passive activity losses. (See \nalso “Nondeductible Passive Losses.”) \nPayments to a Keogh Plan\n(line 16, Schedule 1) \nSelf-employed individuals were allowed to contribute to \na Keogh retirement plan or a simplified employment pension \nplan and to deduct all or part of such contributions in comput-\ning adjusted gross income. The deductible amount was based \non net earnings from self-employment. \nPayment with Request for Extension of Filing \nTime \n(line 10, Schedule 3) \nThis payment was made when the taxpayer filed Form \n4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File \nU.S. Individual Income Tax Return. The extension granted the \ntaxpayer additional time to file a tax return but did not extend \nthe time for paying the expected tax. Full payment of any tax \ndue had to be made with the application for extension. \nPenalty on Early Withdrawal of Savings\n(line 18, Schedule 1) \nTaxpayers who paid penalties for the premature with-\ndrawal of funds from time savings accounts or deposits could \ndeduct those penalties as an adjustment to total income. \nPenalty Tax on Qualified Retirement Plans\n(line 8, Schedule 2) \nIf taxpayers withdrew any funds from an Individual \nRetirement Arrangement or qualified retirement plan before \nthey were either age 59½ or disabled, they were subject to a \npenalty tax equal to 10% of the premature distribution. Any \ntaxpayer who failed to withdraw the minimum required dis-\ntribution after reaching age 72 had to pay a 50-percent excise \ntax on the excess accumulation. Contributions to an IRA in \nexcess of the legal limitation for the year (the lesser of $6,000, \n$12,000 if married filing jointly, or the taxpayer’s compensa-\ntion for the year) were subject to an excise tax equal to 6% \nof the excess contribution. If the taxpayer(s) were over 50, \nthese limits were $1,000 higher per taxpayer. A taxpayer, if \nrequired, filed a Form 5329, Additional Taxes on Qualified \nPlans (Including IRAs) and Other Tax-Favored Accounts, to \nreport these withdrawals and calculate any tax penalty. \nPension or Annuity from Nonqualified \nDeferred Compensation Plan or Section 457 \nPlan ∆ \n(line 8t, Schedule 1) \nAmount the taxpayer received as a pension or annuity \nfrom a nonqualifed deferred compensation plan or a nongov-\nernmental 457 plan. The amount could have been shown in \nbox 11 of Form W-2, or if box blank, taxpayer could have \ncontacted employer for amount. \nPensions and Annuities \n(lines 5a and 5b, Form 1040) \nGenerally, pensions are periodic income received after \nretirement for past services with an employer, while annui-\nties are income payable at stated intervals after payment of \na specific premium. A taxpayer could acquire a pension or \nannuity either by purchase from a commercial organization \n(usually life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts) or \nunder a plan or contract connected with the taxpayer’s employ-\nment. Those pensions or annuities obtained in connection with \nemployment could be purchased entirely by the taxpayer or \nfinanced in part (a contributory plan) or in whole (a noncon-\ntributory plan) through employer contributions. \nSince a noncontributory plan was paid for entirely by an \nemployer, the amount received by the employee was fully \ntaxable. This fully taxable pension was included on lines 5a \nand 5b. For the taxpayer who participated in a contributory \n327 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nExplanation of Terms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nretirement plan while employed, the amount received was only \npartially taxable. In general, the amount excludable from gross \nincome, the nontaxable portion, represented the taxpayer’s con-\ntributions under the plan, while the taxable portion represented \nthe employer’s contribution and earnings on the entire invest-\nment. The nontaxable contribution had to be amortized over \nthe expected lifetime of the taxpayer. \nThe entire amount of pensions and annuities received for \nthe year was reported on line 5a of Form 1040. The taxable \nportion was computed on a separate worksheet and entered \non line 5b. \nPersonal Property Taxes Deduction \n(line 5c, Schedule A) \nPersonal property tax could be included as a deduction \nif the tax was an annual tax based on value alone. (See also \n“Taxes Paid Deduction.”) \nPredetermined Estimated Tax Penalty\n(line 38, Form 1040) \nIf a return showed taxes of $1,000 or more owed on line 37 \n(tax due at time of filing) and this amount was more than 10% \nof the total tax, the taxpayer could owe a penalty, unless tax \npayments in the current year equaled or exceeded prior-year tax \nliability. Also, taxpayers could owe a penalty if they underpaid \ntheir 2022 estimated tax liability for any payment period. Form \n2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, \nand Trusts, was used to determine the amount of a penalty, if \nany. For 2022, paid sick leave and paid family leave credits \nequal to what a taxpayer was required to provide to employ-\nees for qualified sick leave wages and qualified family leave \nwages could reduce payments of estimated income taxes by \nthe amounts of credits. \nFor this report, the predetermined estimated tax penalty \nincludes only the amount calculated by the taxpayer when the \nreturn was initially filed. \nPrior-Year Minimum Tax Credit \n(line 6b, Schedule 3) \nA minimum tax credit could be taken for 2022 by certain \ntaxpayers who paid alternative minimum tax for 2021 or prior \nyears. If all of the minimum tax credit (claimed on Form 8801) \ncould not be used for 2022, the excess could be carried forward \nto later years. Beginning in 2013, a refundable credit was no \nlonger available to taxpayers with a credit carryforward from \nearlier years. \nQualified Business Income Deduction ∆ \n(line 13, Form 1040) \nA taxpayer was able to deduct up to 20% of qualified busi-\nness income from a qualified trade or business, plus 20% of \nqualified REIT (real estate investment trust) dividends and \nqualified PTP (publicly traded partnership) income. The deduc-\ntion could have been taken in addition to a standard deduction \nor itemized deductions. The simplified worksheet for a tax-\npayer to figure the qualified business income deduction was \nForm 8995, Qualified Business Income Deduction Simplified \nComputation. If the taxpayer didn’t meet the taxable income \nrequirements (more than $170,050 if single and $340,100 for \nmarried filing jointly) to file a Form 8995 or was a patron in a \nspecified agricultural or horticultural cooperative, the taxpayer \nused Form 8995-A, Qualified Business Income Deduction. \nQualified Dividends \n(line 3a, Form 1040) \nSee “Dividends.” \nQualified Electric Vehicle Credit \n(line 6i, Schedule 3) \nTaxpayers could have only claimed this credit if they had \nany qualified electric vehicle passive activity credits from prior \nyears that were allowed for the current tax year. This credit \nwas calculated first on Form 8582-CR and then on Form 8834. \nQualified Plug-In Electric Vehicle Credit\n(line 6f, Schedule 3) \nTaxpayers could have claimed this credit for any nonde-\npreciable qualified plug-in electric vehicle placed in service \nduring the tax year. A qualified plug-in electric vehicle is gen-\nerally any vehicle that is propelled to a significant extent by an \nelectric motor that draws electricity from a battery that can be \nrecharged from an external source. This credit was calculated \nby using Form 8936 and brought to line 6f, Schedule 3, for per-\nsonal use of a vehicle. Any credit for business use of a vehicle \nwas brought to Form 3800, General Business Credit. \nQualified Sick and Family Leave Credit for \nLeave Taken After March 31, 2021 \n(line 13h, Schedule 3) \nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted on March \n11, 2021, provided certain self-employed individuals the op-\nportunity to claim credits for up to 10 days of “paid sick leave,” \nand up to 60 days of “paid family leave,” if they were unable \nto work or telework due to circumstances related to coronavi-\nrus. Also, if the taxpayer(s) paid household employment taxes, \nthey could claim a credit for qualified sick and family leave \nwages due to reasons related to coronavirus. These Schedule \nH filers and self-employed individuals claimed these credits for \nthe period beginning on April 1, 2021, and ending September \n30, 2021. \nQualified Sick and Family Leave Credit for \nLeave Taken Before April 1, 2021\n(line 13b, Schedule 3) \nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) \nhelped self-employed individuals and taxpayers who paid \nhousehold employment taxes who were affected by corona-\nvirus.

This credit was \nextended under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 for \nwages paid in 2022 for leave taken after March 31, 2020 and \nbefore April 1, 2021. \nReal Estate Taxes \n(line 5b, Schedule A) \nThis amount included taxes paid on real estate that was \nowned and not used for business by the taxpayer. The real \nestate taxes could only be used for a deduction if the taxes \nwere based on the assessed value of the property. Also, the \nassessment had to be made uniformly on property throughout \nthe community, and the proceeds had to be used for general \ncommunity or governmental purposes. (See also “Taxes Paid \nDeduction.”) \nRecapture Taxes\n(lines 16 and 17a, Schedule 2) \nThe investment tax credit provisions of the law included \na recapture rule which required taxpayers to pay back some \nor all of any investment credit previously taken on property \ndisposed of before the end of the useful life claimed in com-\nputing the credit. The law specified that if property qualifying \nfor the credit was disposed of before the end of its useful life, \nthe tax for the year of disposal was increased by the difference \nbetween the credit originally claimed and the credit that would \nhave been allowed based on the shorter actual life. Tax cred-\nits could not be applied against this additional tax. Also, tax \nfrom recapture of an education credit, the low-income housing \ncredit, the Indian employment credit, the new markets credit, \ncredit for employer-provided child care facilities, the alterna-\ntive motor vehicle credit, the alternative fuel vehicle refueling \ncredit, and the qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle \ncredit, recapture of federal mortgage subsidy, and COBRA \npremium assistance were reported here. \nRefund \n(line 35a, Form 1040) \nA tax refund included all overpayment of income taxes \nnot applied by the taxpayer as a credit to the next year’s esti-\nmated tax. (See also “Overpayment.”) \nRefund Credited to Next Year \n(line 36, Form 1040) \nSee “Credit to 2023 Estimated Tax.” \nRefundable Credits \nSee “Total Refundable Credits.” \nRegular Tax Computation \nTypically, the taxpayer, in determining the amount of \n“tax generated,” first computed taxable income. Depending \non marital status and size of taxable income, the taxpayer then \nused the tax table or applied the rates from one of four tax rate \nschedules to determine tax. Also, returns of taxpayers who had \ntaxes computed by the IRS were classified under the regular \ntax computation method. If a taxpayer filed a Form 8615 or \nhad any long-term capital gains, or qualified dividends taxed \nat a rate less than the tax tables, then the returns were not \nconsidered as having regular tax computations. \nRent Net Income Less Loss \nSee “Rent Net Income or Net Loss.” \nRent Net Income or Net Loss \n(line 21, Schedule E, columns A, B, and C) \nRent net income or net loss was determined by deducting \nfrom gross rent the amounts for depreciation, repairs, improve-\nments, interest, taxes, commissions, advertising, utilities, in-\nsurance, janitorial services, and any other allowable expenses \nrelated to the rented property. In these statistics, total rental net \nloss includes passive losses that were not deductible in figuring \nadjusted gross income. (See also “Passive Activity Losses” \nand “Total Rental and Royalty Income or Loss in AGI.”) \nRepatriated Deferred (Section 965) Income \nas Shareholders of Certain Foreign \nCorporation Future Installments \n(line 13f, Schedule 3) \nTaxpayers were allowed to make payments for the Section \n965 net tax liability portion of their overall income tax liability \nover annual installments. The amount deferred was reported \non line 13f, Schedule 3, as a credit against total taxes. \nRepatriated Deferred (Section 965) Income \nas Shareholders of Certain Foreign \nCorporation Income \n(included in line 8z, Schedule 1) \nA taxpayer who owned (directly or indirectly) certain for-\neign corporations may have had to include certain deferred \nforeign income on their individual income tax returns. The \ntaxpayer may have paid the entire amount of tax due with \nrespect to this deferred foreign income in 2022 or elected to \nmake payments in eight installments, or in the case of certain \nstock owned through an S corporation elect to have deferred \npayment until the occurrence of a triggering event. The income \nwas included on line 8z, Schedule 1, other net income or loss. \nResidential Energy Credits ∆\n(line 5, Schedule 3) \nThe residential energy credit consisted of the energy ef-\nficient home improvement credit and the residential clean \nenergy efficient credit. For the energy efficient home improve-\nment credit, taxpayers were able to take a credit of 10% of the \ncosts paid or incurred in 2022 for qualified energy-efficient \nimprovements and residential energy property.

For the residential clean energy efficient credit, \ntaxpayers could have taken a credit of 30% of their costs of \nqualified solar electric property, solar water heating property, \nsmall wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, \nand fuel cell property. Both of these are calculated using Form \n5695, Residential Energy Credits. \nRetirement Savings Contribution Credit\n(Saver’s Credit) ∆\n(line 4, Schedule 3) \nA taxpayer could take a credit of up to $1,000 ($2,000 if \nmarried filing jointly) for qualified retirement savings contribu-\ntions, if their adjusted gross income was less than or equal to \n$34,000 ($51,000 for head of household, $68,000 for married \nfiling jointly). This credit was calculated by using Form 8880. \nRoth IRA ∆ \n(lines 16-25, Form 8606) \nSimilar to traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs were generally used \nfor retirement. Unlike with traditional IRAs, contributions to a \nRoth IRA were not deductible. However, qualified distributions \nfrom a Roth IRA were tax- exempt. The contribution limit for \nRoth IRAs was the lesser of $6,000 ($7,000 for age 50 or older), \n$12,000, $13,000, or $14,000 (depending on whether none, one, \nor two of the taxpayers were age 50 or older and married filing \njointly), or the individual’s taxable compensation, unless the \ntaxpayer contributed to both Roth and traditional IRAs. In that \ncase, the contribution limit for Roth IRAs was reduced by all \ncontributions (other than employer contributions) to traditional \nIRAs for the taxable year. The eligibility for Roth IRAs was \nphased out for joint filers with modified adjusted gross income \n(AGI) between $204,000 and $214,000, married taxpayers \nfiling separately and living with their spouses with modified \nAGI between $0 and $10,000, and all other filers (single, head \nof household, and married filing separately and not living with \ntheir spouse at any time during the year) with modified AGI \nbetween $129,000 and $144,000. Roth IRA contributions could \nbe made after the taxpayer reached the age of 72. Also, the \nminimum distribution rules did not apply to living taxpayers \nas they did for traditional IRAs. \nStarting in 2010, all taxpayers (including married taxpay-\ners filing separately) were eligible to make taxable rollovers \nof traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs without paying the 10-per-\ncent tax on early withdrawals. When a taxpayer converted an \namount from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, they were re-\nquired to include in gross income the amount that they would \nhave reported in income if they had made a withdrawal from \nthis IRA. The taxpayer did not include in gross income any part \nof the conversion that was a nondeductible contribution in a \ntraditional IRA. (See also “Individual Retirement Arrangement \nTaxable Distributions.”) \nRoyalty Net Income Less Loss\nSee “Royalty Net Income or Net Loss.” \nRoyalty Net Income or Net Loss\n(line 21, Schedule E, columns A, B, and C) \nNet royalties consisted of gross royalties less deductions \nfor depletion, depreciation, office rent, legal fees, clerical help, \ninterest, taxes, and similar items. Gross royalties included rev-\nenues from oil, gas, and other mineral rights; revenue from \npatents; and revenue from literary, musical, or artistic works. \nCertain royalties received under a lease agreement on timber, \ncoal, and domestic iron ore were eligible for capital gains or \nordinary loss treatment under Internal Revenue Code section \n1231. As a result of the separate computation, those royalties \nare reflected in the statistics for “sales of capital assets” and \n“sales of property other than capital assets.” (See also “Total \nRental and Royalty Net Income or Loss.”) \nS Corporations \nSee “Partnership and S Corporation Net Income or Loss.” \nSalaries and Wages ∆\n(line 1z, Form 1040) \nSalaries and wages, as reported on the tax return, were \namounts of compensation primarily for personal services. The \nfollowing items were included: \n•  salaries; \n•  wages,including W-2 wages, household employee wages \nand wages from Form 8919 ; \n•  commissions; \n•  bonuses; \n•  tips; \n•  fees; \n•  excess reimbursement of employee business expenses; \n•  moving expenses allowances; \n•  the difference between the fair market value of certain \nproperty and the discount price for which it was pur-\nchased by a taxpayer from his or her employer; \n•  severance pay; \n•  sick pay; \n•  the value of exercising a stock appreciation right; \n•  directors’ fees; \n•  vacation allowances; \n•  most disability payments; \n•  strike and lockout benefits; \n•  the value of certain nonmonetary payments for services \n(e.g., merchandise, accommodations, certain meals or \nlodging, certain stock purchase plans, or property); \n•  dependent care benefits; \n•  medicaid waiver payments; \n330 \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n• strike or lockout benefits; \n• employer-provided adoption benefits; and \n• scholarship and fellowship grants.  \nIdentifiable amounts for any of these categories, which  \nmay have been reported by taxpayers as “other income,” are \ntreated as salaries and wages for these statistics. \nSales of Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss\n(line 7, Form 1040) \nIn general, capital assets for tax purposes included all \nproperty held for personal use or investment. Examples in-\nclude homes, furniture, automobiles, and stocks and bonds. \nMost assets used for business activities were specifically ex-\ncluded from treatment as capital assets. (See also “Sales of \nProperty Other Than Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss.”) \nThe following concepts are used in the computation of net \ncapital gain or loss for this report: \nLong term or short term: If the holding period was 1 year \nor less, the asset was considered short term; otherwise, it was \nconsidered long term. All capital gain distributions (distribu-\ntions from mutual funds on the profit of sale of stock or bonds \nto the taxpayer) were considered long term. Short-term capital \ngains were taxed at ordinary rates. \nNet capital gain: If the combination of net short-term gain \nor loss and net long-term gain or loss resulted in a positive \namount, the taxpayer had a net capital gain. The full amount \nof this gain, whether short term or long term, was included in \nadjusted gross income (AGI). \nNet capital loss: If the combination of net short-term gain \nor loss and net long-term gain or loss resulted in a negative \namount, the taxpayer showed a net capital loss. The amount \nof net capital loss included in AGI was limited to the smaller \nof the actual net capital loss or $3,000 ($1,500 for married \npersons filing separately). Any excess capital losses over the \n$3,000 limit could be carried over to subsequent tax years. \n(See “Long-Term Loss Carryover” and “Short-Term Loss \nCarryover.”) \nThe maximum rate for most long-term net capital gains \nwas 20% for taxpayers in the top ordinary income brackets. \nFor taxpayers between the 12-percent ordinary income bracket \nand part of the 35% bracket, the capital gain rate was 15%, \nand for taxpayers in the 12-percent ordinary income bracket \nor lower, the capital gain rate was 0%. Collectible gains and \nup to 50% of eligible gains on qualified small business stock \nwere taxed at the 28-percent rate. Gains from the sale of cer-\ntain depreciable real property were taxed at a 25-percent rate. \nTherefore, the long-term capital gain tax rate could be 0%, \n15%, 20%, 25%, or 28%. Taxpayers were generally able to \nexclude from income up to $250,000 ($500,000 for married \ncouples filing a joint tax return) of the gain on the sale of their \nhomes. \nSales of Capital Assets Reported on \nSchedule D \nSee “Sales of Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss.” \nSales of Property Other Than Capital Assets, \nNet Gain Less Loss \n(line 4, Schedule 1) \nProperty other than capital assets generally included prop-\nerty of a business nature, in contrast to personal or investment \nproperty, which were capital assets. Some types of property \nspecifically included in this group were: \n(1)  certain depreciable, depletable, and real business \nproperty; \n(2)  accounts and notes receivable in the ordinary course \nof business generated from the sale of goods and \nservices ordinarily held for sale by the business or \nincludable in the inventory of the business; \n(3)  certain copyrights, literary, musical, or artistic com-\npositions, or similar properties; and \n(4)  amounts resulting from certain “involuntary conver-\nsions,” including net losses from casualty and theft. \nTaxpayers reported all gains and losses not treated as capi-\ntal gains on Form 4797, Sales of Business Property. In some \ncases, these gains and losses were reported on Form 4684, \nCasualties and Thefts, and then brought to line 14 of Schedule \n4797, or if Form 4797 was not otherwise required, brought \ndirectly to line 4, Schedule 1. \nSales Tax Deduction \n(line 5a, Schedule A) \nTaxpayers could have elected to deduct state and local \ngeneral sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes \nas an itemized deduction on Schedule A. The taxpayer could \nhave used either actual expenses or the optional state sales \ntax tables. \nSaver’s Credit \nSee “Retirement Savings Contribution Credit.” \nSchedule D Capital Gain Distributions \n(line 13, Schedule D) \nSee “Sales of Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss.” \nSelf-Employed Health Insurance Deduction\n(line 17, Schedule 1) \nSelf-employed persons or owners of more than 2% of out-\nstanding stock of an S Corporation, if they were not eligible \nfor health coverage under an employer-provided plan, were \nallowed to deduct, in the calculation of adjusted gross income, \nup to 100% of the amount paid for health insurance for them-\nselves and their families. \n331 \nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\nExplanation of Terms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSelf-Employed Pension Plans (SEP), \nSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees \n(SIMPLE), and Qualified Plans\nSee “Payments to a Keogh Plan.” \nSelf-Employment Tax ∆\n(line 4, Schedule 2) \nAll net earnings greater than $400 ($108.28 for church em-\nployees) were subject to the self-employment tax. The ceiling \nfor the Social Security tax on taxable self-employment income \nfor 2022 was $147,000. The limit did not apply for purposes \nof the Medicare tax. This tax was calculated on Schedule SE. \nBeginning in 2013, the self-employment tax rate reverted \nto 15.3% from 13.3%. The Medicare portion of the self-em-\nployment tax remained at 2.9%, while the Social Security por-\ntion was increased to 12.4% from 10.4%. Also beginning in \n2013, a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax applied to self-employ-\nment income above $200,000 for single, head of household, \nor qualifying widow(er) ($250,000 for married filing jointly or \nfor married filing separately). (See also “Total Tax Liability”) \nShort-Term Loss Carryover\n(line 6, Schedule D) \nThese are short-term capital losses from the prior-year \nSchedule D that were carried over to the current year. (See \n“Sales of Capital Assets, Net Gain or Loss.”) \nSize of Adjusted Gross Income\n(line 11, Form 1040) \nThe amount of adjusted gross income (AGI) reported by \nthe taxpayer on the return was the basis for classifying data \nby size of AGI. Returns without positive AGI, such as deficit \nreturns or returns on which income and loss were equal, were \nclassified as having “no adjusted gross income” and appear \nas a separate class in most basic tables. The absence of a class \nlabeled “no adjusted gross income” indicates that any deficit \nor break-even returns in a table were included in the lowest in-\ncome-size class. (See “Adjusted Gross Income Less Deficit.”) \nSocial Security and Medicare Tax on \nUnreported Tip Income\n(line 5, Schedule 2) \nCash tips amounting to $20 or more received by the tax-\npayer in a month while working for any one employer were \nsubject to withholding of income tax, Social Security tax (or \nthe equivalent railroad retirement tax), and Medicare tax. If \nthe employer was unable to withhold the Social Security and \nMedicare tax, the amount of uncollected Social Security tax \non tips was indicated on the employee’s Form W-2, and the \nemployee was required to report the uncollected tax and pay it \nwith Form 1040. If the employee did not report the tips to the \nemployer, the employee was required to compute the Social \nSecurity and Medicare tax on unreported tips on Form 4137 \nand attach it to Form 1040. \nSocial Security and Medicare Taxes ∆\nFor 2022, the maximum wage subject to Social Security \ntax was $147,000. All wages were subject to Medicare tax. \nBeginning in 2013, the Social Security tax reverted to 6.2% \nfrom 4.2%. The Medicare tax portion remained at 1.45%. Also \nbeginning in 2013, a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax applied \nto Medicare wages, railroad retirement compensation, and \nself-employment income above $200,000 for single, head of \nhousehold, or qualifying widow(er) ($250,000 if married filing \njointly or if married filing separately). \nSocial Security Benefits\n(lines 6a and 6b, Form 1040) \n“Social Security benefits” included any monthly benefit \nunder Title II of the Social Security Act or the part of a “tier \n1 railroad retirement benefit” that was equivalent to a Social \nSecurity benefit. Social Security benefits were not taxable \nunless the taxpayer’s total income (including tax-exempt in-\nterest) plus one-half of total Social Security benefits exceeded \ncertain levels. The maximum taxable amount was up to 85% \nof the net Social Security benefits received. Social Security \nbenefits received were reported on line 6a, Form 1040, and \nthe taxable portion was reported on line 6b. If taxpayers met \nthe requirements for filing a tax return, they were required \nto report gross Social Security benefits on line 6a even if the \ntaxpayers had no taxable Social Security benefits. \nStandard Deduction ∆ \n(included in line 12, Form 1040) \nFor 2022, the basic standard deduction was increased for \nall filers. Taxpayers who were age 65 or over or blind could \nclaim an additional standard deduction amount of $1,400 or \n$1,750, based on filing status. Both the basic and additional \nstandard deductions were determined by marital filing status, \nas shown below: \nSingle \nBasic deduction of $12,950; \nEach taxpayer 65 or over or blind was allowed an \nadditional $1,750 deduction each for age and blindness. \nMarried filing jointly or surviving spouses \nBasic deduction of $25,900; \nEach taxpayer 65 or over or blind was allowed an \nadditional $1,400 deduction each for age and blindness. \nMarried, filing separately \nBasic deduction of $12,950; \nEach taxpayer 65 or over or blind was allowed an \nadditional $1,400 deduction each for age and blindness. \nHead of household \nBasic deduction of $19,400; \n332 \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach taxpayer 65 or over or blind was allowed an addi-\ntional $1,750 deduction each for age and blindness. \nThe basic standard deduction claimed by filers who were \ndependents of other taxpayers was the greater of $1,150 or the \ndependent’s earned income plus $400 (but not more than the \nregular standard deduction amount). \nIn these statistics, the basic standard deduction is tabu-\nlated for all taxpayers who claimed it, including those who \nwere 65 or over and/or blind. The “additional standard deduc-\ntion” total includes only the additional amount that was taken \nby those taxpayers who were 65 or over and/or blind. \nState and Local Income Taxes \n(included in line 5a, Schedule A) \nState and local income taxes paid could be used as an \nitemized deduction if a taxpayer had state and local income \ntaxes withheld from their salary during 2022, had paid state \nand local income taxes directly during 2022 for a prior year, or \nhad made mandatory contributions to specific state disability \nfunds. (See also “Taxes Paid Deduction.”) \nState and Local Taxes \n(line 5a, Schedule A) \nThis is the total of “State and local income taxes” or “sales \ntax deduction.” The taxpayer could elect to use either, but not \nboth. \nState Income Tax Refund \n(line 1, Schedule 1) \nIf a taxpayer received a refund, credit, or offset of state or \nlocal income taxes in 2022 that was paid or deducted before \n2022, all or part of that amount had to be reported as income to \nthe extent that an itemized deduction for state and local income \ntaxes had previously resulted in a tax benefit. \nStatutory Adjustments ∆\n(lines 11-26, Schedule 1) \nCertain adjustments to total income were allowed as \ndeductions in the calculation of adjusted gross income. For \n2022, statutory adjustments included educator expenses; cer-\ntain business expenses of reservists, performing artists, and \nfee-basis government officials; health savings account deduc-\ntions; moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces; the \ndeductible part of self-employment tax, payments to a self-\nemployed Keogh retirement plan or a simplified employee \npension, and the self-employed health insurance deduction; \npenalty on early withdrawal of savings; alimony paid; pay-\nments to an IRA; student loan interest deductions; Archer \nmedical savings account deductions; and the foreign housing \ndeduction. Each of the above items is described separately in \nthis section. In addition, statutory adjustments included jury \nduty pay, deductible expenses related to income of personal \nproperty, nontaxable amount of the value of Olympic and \nParalympic medals and USOC prize money, the forestation/ \nreforestation amortization deduction, the repayment of supple-\nmental unemployment benefits under the Trade Act of 1974, \ncontributions to section 501(c)(18)(D) pension plans, contribu-\ntions by certain chaplains to section 403(b) plans, attorney fees \nand court costs paid for actions involving certain unlawful \ndiscrimination claims, and attorney fees and court costs paid \nin connection with an award from the IRS for information \nprovided that helped the IRS detect tax law violations. If not \nlisted separately, these amounts are included in the “other ad-\njustments” category in the statistics. \nStudent Loan Interest Deduction ∆ \n(line 21, Schedule 1) \nFor 2022, eligible taxpayers were allowed to deduct up to \n$2,500 for interest paid on qualified higher-education loans. \nThe deduction was phased out for taxpayers with modified \nadjusted gross income between $70,000 to $85,000 ($145,000 \nto $175,000 for taxpayers filing a joint return). \nTax Credits \nSee “Total Tax Credits.” \nTax Due at Time of Filing\n(line 37, Form 1040) \n“Tax due” was reported on returns on which total tax li-\nability exceeded total tax payments. \nTax from Recomputing Prior-Year Investment \nCredit \n(included in line 17a, Schedule 2) \nSee “Recapture Taxes.” \nTax Generated ∆ \nThis amount was the tax computed on modified taxable \nincome. The tax rates for 2022 were 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35, \nand 37%. The 10-percent bracket applied to taxable income \nequal to or below $10,275 for single filers and married persons \nfiling separately, $20,550 for joint filers or surviving spouses, \nand $14,650 for heads of household. The 12-percent bracket \napplied to taxable income in excess of the 10-percent bracket \nceiling and equal to or below $41,775 for single filers and \nmarried persons filing separately, $83,550 for joint filers or \nsurviving spouses, and $55,900 for heads of household. The \n22-percent tax bracket applied to taxable income in excess of \nthe 12-percent bracket ceiling and equal to or below $89,075 \nfor single filers and married persons filing separately, $89,050 \nfor heads of households, and $178,150 for joint filers or surviv-\ning spouses. The 24-percent tax rate applied to taxable income \nin excess of the 22-percent tax bracket ceiling and equal to or \nbelow $170,050 for single filers and married persons filing sep-\narately, and head of households, and $340,100 for joint filers or \nsurviving spouses.

The 37-percent tax rate applied to taxable income in \nexcess of the upper boundary for the 35-percent tax bracket. \nThe tax generated at each of these tax rates is shown in Tables \n3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. \nIf children under age 19, or under 24 if they were a full-\ntime student, had investment (unearned) income that exceeded \n$2,500, there were two methods of reporting this income. If the \nchild filed his or her own return, the investment income that ex-\nceeded $2,500 was taxed at the parents’ rate on Form 8615 (the \nremaining investment income was taxed at the child’s rate) and \ntabulated separately in Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. If the parents \nelected to report the child’s investment income on their return, \nthey attached a Form 8814. The investment income in excess \nof $2,500 was included on either line 9, Form 1040, Schedule \n1, or in the case of capital gain distributions on either line 7, \nForm 1040, or line 13, Schedule D, or qualified dividends on \nlines 3a and 3b, Form 1040. The remaining investment income \nthat was more than the $1,150 standard deduction was taxed at \nthe child’s rate, added to the parents’ tax on Form 1040, line \n16, and is also tabulated separately in Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. \nOn most returns, except those with additional taxes from \nspecial computations, “tax generated” equaled “income tax \nbefore credits.” (See also “Modified Taxable Income.”) \nTax Payments\n(lines 25a-d, Form 1040; lines 10, 11, 12, and 13z, Schedule 3) \nThese payments were generally made before the return \nwas filed and were applied against tax liability to determine \nany amount payable or refundable at the time of filing. They \nconsisted of the following: \n(1) income tax withheld, including backup withholding; \n(2)  estimated tax payments (including those from over-\npayment on the 2021 return); \n(3) payment with request for extension of filing time; \n(4)  excess Social Security, Medicare, or railroad retire-\nment tax withheld; \n(5)  credit for tax on certain gasoline, fuel, and oil; and \n(6)  other payments. \nEach of the above is described under a separate heading \nin this section. \nAlthough the earned income credit, additional child tax \ncredit, American opportunity credit, net premium tax credit, \nregulated investment company credit, and qualified sick and \nfamily leave credits were included with tax payments on the \ntax return itself (lines 27, 28, and 29, Form 1040; 9, 13a, 13b, \nand 13h, Schedule 3), for the statistics they are treated partly \nas a credit against income tax liability and partly as a refund-\nable amount. (See also “Earned Income Credit,” “Additional \nChild Tax Credit,” “Education Credits,” “Net Premium Tax \nCredit,” “Credit from Regulated Investment Companies,” \n“Qualified Sick and Family Leave Credit After March 31, \n2021,” and “Qualified Sick and Family Leave Credit Before \nApril 1, 2021,.”). \nTax Penalty \n(line 38, Form 1040) \nSee “Predetermined Estimated Tax Penalty.” \nTax Rates, Tax Rate Classes \nSee “Tax Generated.”  \nTax Withheld \n(lines 25a-d, Form 1040) \nSee “Income Tax Withheld.” \nTaxable and Nontaxable Returns  ∆ \nThe taxable and nontaxable classification of a return for \nthis report is determined by the presence of “total income tax.” \nSome returns classified as “nontaxable” may have had a li-\nability for other taxes, such as excess advance premium tax \ncredit (APTC) repayment, self-employment tax, uncollected \nemployee Social Security and Medicare tax on tips, tax from \nrecomputing prior-year investment credit, penalty taxes on in-\ndividual retirement accounts, section 72 penalty taxes, house-\nhold employment taxes, Additional Medicare Taxes, or golden \nparachute payments. These taxes, however, were disregarded \nfor the purposes of this classification, since four of the above \ntaxes were considered Social Security (rather than income) \ntaxes, and the remaining ones either were based on prior-year \nincome or were penalty taxes. The APTC repayment was not an \nincome tax but a repayment of money previously advanced to \ntaxpayers for paying for health insurance purchased on a health \ncare exchange. Net Investment Income Tax from Form 8960 \nwas added to income tax after credits to create income tax. \nFor this report, the earned income credit, additional child \ncredit, American opportunity credit, premium tax credit, regu-\nlated investment company credit, and qualified sick and family \nleave credits are treated first as an amount used to offset income \ntax before credits. Since they were refundable, they were sub-\ntracted from income tax (for the statistics) after reduction by \nall other statutory credits. As a result, some returns became \nnontaxable strictly because of the refundable credits when the \nrefundable credits equaled or exceeded income tax before cred-\nits reduced by any other credits. \nIt should be noted that classification as taxable or nontax-\nable was based on each return as it was filed and does not \nreflect any changes resulting from audit or other enforcement \nactivities.

(See “Modified Taxable Income.”) \nTaxable Interest Received \n(line 2b, Form 1040) \nThis amount was the taxable portion of interest received \nfrom bonds, debentures, notes, mortgages, certain insurance \npolicy proceeds, personal loans, bank deposits, savings depos-\nits, tax refunds, and U.S. savings bonds. Also included as in-\nterest were “dividends” on deposits or withdrawable accounts \nin mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, and \ncredit unions. Interest on State or local government obligations \nremained tax-exempt, but the total tax-exempt interest had \nto be reported on line 2a of Form 1040. It was not included \nin the taxpayer’s income for tax purposes. If taxable interest \nexceeded $1,500, the taxpayer had to fill out Schedule B to \nsupply the details for taxable interest.

The deduction for state and local income and real estate, \nsales, and property taxes was limited to a combined, total \ndeduction of $10,000 ($5,000 for married filing separately). \nMandatory employee contributions to a state disability fund \nand employee contributions to a state unemployment fund \nwere also included. However, foreign real estate taxes were \nno longer deductible. Also, federal taxes were not deductible. \nTaxes paid on business property were deducted separately on \nthe schedules for business, rent, royalty, and farm income and \nare excluded from the “taxes paid” statistics in this report. \nTax-Exempt Interest\n(line 2a, Form 1040) \nTax-exempt interest included interest on certain state and \nmunicipal bonds, as well as any tax-exempt interest dividends \nfrom a mutual fund or other regulated investment company. \nThis was an information reporting requirement and did not \nconvert tax-exempt interest into taxable interest. It is included \nas income for certain programs, for example for the earned \nincome credit or taxability of Social Security benefits. \nTip Income Not Reported on Form W-2 \nWages ∆\n(line 1c, Form 1040) \nTotal tip income that was not reported on Form 1040, line \n1a.

It did not \ninclude any of the other taxes that made up total tax liability. \nThis amount was limited to zero. Total income tax was the \nbasis for classifying returns as taxable or nontaxable. \nTotal Income Tax Minus Refundable Credits\n “Total income tax minus refundable credits” was the sum \nof total income tax minus the part of refundable credits used to \noffset other taxes and the refundable part of the credits. This \namount can be negative. \nTotal Itemized Deductions∆ \n(included in line 12, Form 1040) \nItemized deductions from adjusted gross income (AGI) \ncould be claimed for medical and dental expenses, certain \ntaxes paid, interest paid, charitable contributions, casualty and \ntheft losses, and miscellaneous deductions. For 2022, taxpay-\ners could no longer deduct mortgage insurance premiums for \nmortgage contracts. Itemized deductions were claimed only if \nthey exceeded the total standard deduction, with three excep-\ntions. First, if a taxpayer was married and filing separately, and \nhis or her spouse itemized deductions, the spouse was required \nto itemize as well. Second, taxpayers in several States were \nrequired to itemize deductions on their federal tax returns if \nthey wished to itemize on their State returns. Third, if a tax-\npayer benefited for alternative minimum tax purposes, they \nmight itemize even though the standard deduction was larger. \nThe total amount of itemized deductions was tabulated only \nfrom returns showing positive AGI. \nTotal Mortgage Interest and Points\n(line 8e, Schedule A) \n“Total mortgage interest and points” was the sum of home \nmortgage interest paid to individuals, interest paid to financial \ninstitutions, and deductible points. (See also “Home Mortgage \nInterest Deduction,” and “Deductible Points.”) \nTotal Nonrefundable Credits \n(line 8, Schedule 3) \nTotal nonrefundable credits is the sum of all the Part I \nnonrefundable credits on Schedule 3, lines 1 through 5 and \nline 7.  \nTotal Pensions and Annuities \n(line 5a, Form 1040) \nSee “Pensions and Annuities.” \nTotal Premium Tax Credit \n(line 24, Form 8962) \nA taxpayer may have been eligible for the premium tax \ncredit if they, their spouse, or a dependent enrolled in health \ninsurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace. The pre-\nmium tax credit was used to help pay for this health insurance. \nThe total premium tax credit was the amount that a taxpayer \nwas eligible to receive. The eligible amount was calculated by \nusing taxpayers’ modified adjusted gross income, family size, \nand the amount of the premiums paid. If the total premium \ntax credit that a taxpayer was eligible for was greater than the \nadvance payments of the premium tax credit that the taxpayer \nhad already received, then the taxpayer claimed the difference \nas a refundable credit in the form of the net premium tax credit. \nIf advance payments of the premium tax credit were more than \nthe premium tax credit the taxpayer could claim, the taxpayer \nhad to pay an excess advance premium tax credit repayment. \n(See also “Advance Payment of Premium Tax Credit,” “Excess \nAdvance Premium Tax Credit Repayment,” and “Net Premium \nTax Credit.”) \nTotal Refundable Credits ∆ \nRefundable credits were separated into three categories \nfor their treatment on income tax for the statistics. The first \ncategory was the portion of the credit used to offset income \ntax before credits. If there was any unused credit amount after \noffsetting of income tax, the next portion offset all other taxes. \nAny remaining amount, after offsetting of all other taxes, was \nput into the last category, called the refundable portion. A tax-\npayer claiming these credits could potentially have the credits \nbroken down into one, two, or all three of these categories. \nFor 2022, credits broken down this way included the earned \nincome credit, additional child tax credit, American oppor-\ntunity credit, net premium tax credit, regulated investment \ncompany credit, qualified sick and family leave credit after \nMarch 31, 2021, and qualified sick and family leave credit \nbefore April 1, 2021. \n336 \nExplanation of Terms\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Refundable Credits, Refundable \nPortion \nSee “Total Refundable Credits.” \nTotal Refundable Credits Used To Offset All \nOther Taxes \nSee “Total Refundable Credits.” \nTotal Refundable Credits Used To Offset \nIncome Tax Before Credits \nSee “Total Refundable Credits.” \nTotal Rental and Royalty Net Income or Loss \n(line 26 + lines 39 and 40, Schedule E) \nThis income concept consisted of all rent and royalty \nincome and loss that were used in computing adjusted gross \nincome (AGI), including farm rental income and suspended \nrental loss carry-over from prior years.

    "text": "Section 7  \nDescription  \nof the Sample \nT\nhis section describes the domain of the study, the sample \ndesign and selection, data capture and cleaning, the \nmethod of estimation, the sampling variability of the \nestimates, the methodology of computing confidence inter-\nvals, and the table presentation. \nDomain of Study\nThe statistics in this report are estimates from a probability \nsample of unaudited Individual Income Tax Returns (Form \n1040 and 1040-SR (including electronic returns)) filed by U.S. \ncitizens and residents during Calendar Year (CY) 2023. \nAll returns processed during 2023 were subjected to sam-\npling, except tentative and amended returns. Tentative returns \nwere not subjected to sampling because the revised returns \nmay have been sampled later. Meanwhile amended returns \nwere excluded because the original returns had already been \nsubjected to sampling. A small percentage of returns were not \nidentified as tentative or amended until after sampling. These \nreturns, along with those that had no income information, \nfrivolous income information, or fraudulent income informa-\ntion, when recognized, were excluded in calculating estimates. \nThe estimates in this report are intended to represent all \nreturns filed for Tax Year (TY) 2022. While most of the re-\nturns processed during CY 2023 were filed for TY 2022, the \nremaining returns were mostly for prior years, and a few for \nnoncalendar years ending during 2020 and 2021. \nSample Design and Selection\nThe sample design is a stratified probability sample in which \nthe population of tax returns is classified into subpopula-\ntions, called strata, and an independent sample is randomly \nselected from each stratum. Strata are defined by the following \ncharacteristics: \n1.  Nontaxable (including no alternative minimum tax) with \nadjusted gross income or expanded income of $200,000 \nor more; \nValerie Testa and Tracy Haines designed the sample and prepared \nthe text and the tables in this section under the direction of Tammy \nRib, Chief, SOI Program Support, Statistical Services Branch. \n2.  High business receipts of $50,000,000 or more; \n3.  Presence or absence of special forms or schedules (Form \n2555, Form 1116, Form 1040 Schedule C, and Form 1040 \nSchedule F); and \n4.  Indexed positive or negative income. Sixty variables are \nused to derive positive and negative incomes. These posi-\ntive and negative income classes are deflated using the \nChain-Type Price Index for the Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP) to represent a base year of 2016. (See footnote [1] \nfor details.) \nTable C shows the population and sample count for each \nstratum. (See references [1] and [2] for details.) The sampling \nrates range from 0.10% to 100%. \nTax data processed to the IRS Individual Master File at \nthe Enterprise Computing Center at Martinsburg during CY \n2023 were used to assign each taxpayer’s record to the appro-\npriate stratum and to determine whether the record should be \nincluded in the sample. Records are selected for the sample \neither if they possess certain combinations of the 4 ending \ndigits of their Social Security Number (SSN), or if their 5 \nending digits of an 11-digit number generated by a mathemati-\ncal transformation of the SSN is less than or equal to the stra-\ntum sampling rate times 100,000. (See reference 3 for details.) \nData Capture and Cleaning\nData capture for the SOI sample begins with the designa-\ntion of a sample of administrative records. While the sample \nwas being selected, the process was continually monitored \nfor sample selection and data collection errors. In addition, a \nsmall subsample of returns was selected and independently \nreviewed, analyzed, and processed for a quality evaluation. \nThe administrative data and controlling information for \neach record designated for this sample were loaded into an \nonline submission processing database. Computer data for the \nselected administrative records were then used to identify in-\nconsistencies, questionable values, and missing values, as well \nas any additional variables that an editor needed to extract for \neach record. \nDescription of the Sample\nIndividual Income Tax Returns 2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAfter the completion of the submission processing center \nreview, data were further validated, tested, and balanced. \nAdjustments and imputations for selected fields based on \nprior-year data and other available information were used \nto make each record internally consistent. Finally, prior to \npublication, all statistics and tables were reviewed for accuracy \nand reasonableness considering the provisions of the tax law, \ntaxpayer reporting variations and limitations, economic \nconditions, and comparability with other statistical series. \nSome returns designated for the sample were not avail-\nable for SOI processing because other areas of the IRS needed \nthe return at the same time. For TY 2022, about 0.08% of the \nsample returns were unavailable. \nMethod of Estimation \nWeights were obtained by dividing the population count of \nreturns in a stratum by the number of sampled returns for that \nstratum. The weights were adjusted to correct for misclassified \nreturns and were then applied to the sample data to produce \nall the estimates in this report. \nSampling Variability and Confidence \nIntervals \nThe sample used in this study is one of a large number of \nsamples that could have been selected using the same sample \ndesign. The estimates calculated from these different samples \nwould vary. The standard error (SE) of an estimate is a mea-\nsure of the variation among the estimates from the possible \nsamples and, thus, is a measure of the precision with which an \nestimate from a particular sample approximates the average of \nthe estimates calculated from all possible samples. \nThe SE may be expressed as a percentage of the value \nbeing estimated. This ratio is called the coefficient of variation \n(CV). Tables 1.4CV, 2.1CV, and 3.3CV contain CVs calculated \nfor the estimates included in Tables 1.4, 2.1, and 3.3 of this \nreport. \nThe sample estimate and an estimate of its SE permit the \nconstruction of interval estimates with prescribed confidence \nthat the interval includes the population value. If all possible \nsamples were selected under essentially the same conditions \nand an estimate and its estimated SE were calculated from \neach sample, then 95% of the intervals would include the pop-\nulation value. This is a 95% confidence interval (CI). \nTables 1.4CI, 2.1CI, and 3.3CI contain estimated 95% con-\nfidence intervals for the estimates included in Tables 1.4, 2.1, \nand 3.3 of this report. \nTable Presentation \nWhenever an unweighted frequency is less than 3, the estimate \nand its corresponding amount are either combined or deleted \nto avoid disclosure of information about specific taxpayers. \n(The combined or deleted data, if any, are included in the cor-\nresponding column totals.)  These combinations and deletions \nare indicated by a double asterisk (**). Estimates based on less \nthan 10 sampled returns are considered unreliable. These esti-\nmates are noted by a single asterisk (*) to the left of the data. \nIn the tables, a dash (-) in place of a frequency or an \namount indicates that either no returns in the population had \nthe characteristic or the characteristic was so rare that it did \nnot appear on any of the sampled returns. \nFootnote \n[1] Indexing of positive and negative income is performed by \ndividing each by the ratio of the Chain-Type Price Index \nfor the GDP for the third quarter of 2022 to that for the \nthird quarter of the base year of 2016[4]. \nReferences \n[1] Hostetter, S.`, Czajka, J.
