The \nmost recent version can be downloaded at: www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4491x.pdf\nVolunteer Standards of Conduct\nVolunteer Income Tax Assistance / Tax Counseling for the Elderly (VITA/TCE)\nThe mission of the VITA/TCE return preparation programs is to assist eligible taxpayers in satisfying their tax \nresponsibilities by providing free tax return preparation. To establish the greatest degree of public trust, volunteers are \nrequired to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct and provide quality service.\nAnnually all VITA/TCE volunteers must pass the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) certification test and agree that \nthey will adhere to the VSC by signing and dating Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement – VITA/TCE \nPrograms, prior to volunteering at a VITA/TCE site. In addition, return preparers, quality reviewers, coordinators, client \nfacilitators, and tax law instructors must certify in Intake/Interview and Quality Review. Volunteers who answer tax law \nquestions, instruct tax law classes, prepare or correct tax returns, or conduct quality reviews of completed returns must \nalso certify in tax law prior to signing the form. Form 13615 is not valid until the sponsoring partner’s approving official \n(coordinator, instructor, administrator, etc.) or IRS contact confirms the volunteer’s identity, name, and address, using \ngovernment-issued photo identification, and signs and dates the form. Volunteers’ names and addresses in Link & Learn \ntaxes must match their government-issued photo identification. Advise volunteers to update their My Account page in \nLink & Learn Taxes with their valid name and address.\nAs a volunteer in the VITA/TCE programs, you must adhere to the following Volunteer Standards of Conduct:\nVSC #1 – Follow all Quality Site Requirements (QSR).\nVSC #2 – Do not accept payment, ask for donations, or accept refund payments for federal or state tax return \npreparation from customers.\nVSC #3 – Do not solicit business from taxpayers you help or use the information you gained about them (taxpayer \ninformation) for any direct or indirect personal benefit for yourself, any other specific individual or organization.\nVSC #4 – Do not knowingly prepare false returns.\nVSC #5 – Do not engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, notoriously disgraceful conduct, or any other conduct \nconsidered to have a negative effect on the VITA/TCE programs.\nVSC #6 – Treat all taxpayers in a professional, courteous, and respectful manner.\nFailure to comply with these standards could result in, but is not limited to, the following:\n•\t Removal from all VITA/TCE programs\n•\t Inclusion in the IRS Volunteer Registry to bar future VITA/TCE activity indefinitely\n•\t Deactivation of your sponsoring partner’s site VITA/TCE electronic filing identification number (EFIN)\n•\t Removal of all IRS products, supplies, loaned equipment, and taxpayer information from your site\n•\t Termination of your sponsoring organization’s partnership with the IRS\n•\t Termination of grant funds from the IRS to your sponsoring partner and\n•\t Referral of your conduct for potential TIGTA and criminal investigations\nTaxSlayer® is a copyrighted software program owned by Rhodes Computer Services.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe integrity of the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) \nprograms depends on maintaining public trust. All taxpayers using VITA/TCE services should be confident \nthey are receiving accurate tax return preparation and quality service.\nAll volunteers are responsible for providing the highest quality and best service to taxpayers. Along with this \nresponsibility, all volunteers must sign and date Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement – \nVITA/TCE Programs, each year, stating they will uphold the highest ethical standards and follow all Quality \nSite Requirements (QSR). \nFurthermore, all IRS Stakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication (IRS-SPEC) partners \nmust sign either Form 13533, Sponsor Agreement or Form 13533-A, FSA Remote Sponsor Agreement, \ncertifying they will adhere to the strictest standards of ethical conduct. By signing this agreement, the \nsponsor agrees to make certain their volunteers are aware of the standards of conduct and the key \nprinciples of privacy and confidentiality. \nNew volunteers must complete the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) Training. Returning volunteers \nare encouraged to review the VSC Training as a refresher. All VITA/TCE volunteers must pass a VSC \ncertification test with a score of 80% or higher. The VSC Training will provide:\n•  An explanation of the six Volunteer Standards of Conduct listed on Form 13615\n•  Information on how to report possible violations\n•  Consequences of failure to adhere to the program requirements\n•  Examples of situations that raise questions on ethical behavior\nWhy do we have Ethics Training?\nDuring past filing seasons, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) and IRS-SPEC \ndiscovered unacceptable practices at a few VITA/TCE sites. In response to these issues, IRS-SPEC \nenhanced the Volunteer Standards of Conduct. The intent is to provide guidance and a structure for \nregulating VITA/TCE volunteers and to protect taxpayers.\nWhen unscrupulous volunteers intentionally ignore the law, it compromises the integrity of the VITA/TCE \nprogram and the public’s trust. Unfortunately, due to the actions of a few, the VITA/TCE programs’ integrity \nand trust have been tested. In these cases, IRS-SPEC can and does take appropriate actions against the \npartners and volunteers involved.\nIRS-SPEC is ultimately responsible for oversight of the VITA/TCE program. The agency often \nreceives complaints from taxpayers, partners, and congressional members when notices are issued. \nIRS-SPEC researches and responds to all inquiries.\n 2\nObjectives\nAt the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n•  List the six Volunteer Standards of Conduct\n•  Describe unethical behavior\n•  Use the external referral process to report unethical behavior\n•  Identify consequences for failing to comply with the standards\n•  Explain how volunteers are protected\nUnethical Defined\nIRS-SPEC defines unethical as not conforming to agreed standards of \nmoral conduct, especially within a particular profession. In most cases, \nunethical behavior is acted upon with the intent to disregard the established \nlaws, procedures, or set policies.\nDo not confuse an unethical action with a lack of knowledge or a simple \nmistake.\nMary prepared a return which included a credit the taxpayer did not qualify for. Mary did not under­\nstand the law, so she did not act unethically. However, if Mary knowingly allowed a credit for which the \ntaxpayer did not qualify, Mary committed an unethical act and violated the Volunteer Standards of Conduct.\nVolunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC)\nOften volunteers face ethical issues, which arise in unexpected situations requiring quick decisions and \ngood judgment. In many cases, the volunteer will react to unusual situations and not realize until later that it \nwas, in fact, an ethical dilemma.\nThe Volunteer Standards of Conduct were developed specifically for the operation of free tax preparation \nprograms. Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement – VITA/TCE Programs, applies to all \nconduct and ethical behavior affecting the VITA/TCE programs. Volunteers must agree to adhere to the \nstandards of conduct prior to working in a VITA/TCE free tax return preparation site.\nAll participants in the VITA/TCE programs must adhere to these Volunteer Standards of Conduct:\nVSC #1 – Follow all Quality Site Requirements (QSR).\nVSC #2 – \u0007Do not accept payment, ask for donations, or accept refund payments for federal or state tax \nreturn preparation from customers.\nVSC #3 – \u0007Do not solicit business from taxpayers you help or use the information you gained about them \n(taxpayer information) for any direct or indirect personal benefit for yourself, any other specific \nindividual or organization.\nVSC #4 – Do not knowingly prepare false returns.\n\u0007VSC #5 – Do not engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, notoriously disgraceful conduct, or any other \nconduct considered to have a negative effect on the VITA/TCE programs.\nVSC #6 – Treat all taxpayers in a professional, courteous, and respectful manner.\nVSC #1 – Follow all Quality Site Requirements (QSR).\nThe purpose of the Quality Site Requirements (QSR) is to ensure the quality and accuracy of tax return \npreparation and consistent operation of sites.\nWhat do I need?\n•  Form 13615, Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct \nAgreement – VITA/TCE \nPrograms\n•  Publication 5683, \nVITA/TCE Handbook \nfor Partners and Site \nCoordinators \n•  Publication 4299, Privacy, \nConfidentiality, and Civil \nRights – A Public Trust\n 3\nNon-adherence to any QSR only becomes a violation of the VSC if volunteers refuse to follow the QSR. If \nthe problem is corrected, it is not a violation of the VSC.\nRefer to Publication 5166, VITA/TCE Volunteer Quality Site Requirements, for a full explanation of each \nQSR. See a brief description of the ten QSR below:\nQSR #1, Certification\nVolunteers must complete their certifications using the IRS electronic tests through Link & Learn \nTaxes (LLT). Volunteers who prefer to take the Certification Test on paper utilizing Form 6744, VITA/\nTCE Volunteer Assistor’s Test or Retest, may continue to complete the test using that method but must \ntranscribe their answers to the test in LLT.  Volunteers’ names and addresses in Link & Learn taxes must \nmatch their government-issued photo identification. SPEC recommends that volunteers update their My \nAccount page in LLT with their valid name and address.\n•  Volunteer training may consist of classroom training, self-study, and/or LLT.\n•  Volunteers have two attempts to pass each certification with a passing score of 80% or above on each \ncertification.\nVolunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) Training \nNew volunteers must take the VSC Training. The training is available in LLT and in Publication 4961, \nVITA/TCE Volunteer Standards of Conduct – Ethics Training. SPEC encourages returning volunteers to \nreview the VSC training as a refresher. All volunteers must pass the VSC certification using LLT prior to \nworking at a site. \nVITA/TCE Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training  \nAll new and returning volunteer instructors, preparers, coordinators, and quality reviewers must take \nPublication 5101, VITA/TCE Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training and pass Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review certification. Volunteer greeters, screeners and client facilitators who assist taxpayers with \ncompleting Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, must also take Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review Training and certify. \n•  This training will be offered virtually with a Q&A session via Webcaster. Link is available in Publication \n5325, Fact Sheet: Filing Season Training for SPEC Partners and Volunteers. \n•  All volunteer greeters, screeners and client facilitators who assign tax returns for return preparation must \nalso take Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training and certify.  \nVITA/TCE Tax Law Training\nVolunteers who answer tax law questions, instruct tax law classes, prepare, or correct tax returns, and/or \nconduct quality reviews of completed tax returns, must certify in tax law prior to conducting tax law related \ntasks. Screeners and client facilitators who answer tax law questions must also certify in tax law. Tax law \ncertification is an annual requirement. Volunteers who do not help with tax law related issues (for example, \ngreeters, receptionists, equipment coordinators) do not have to certify in tax law but must still complete \nthe VSC certification test via LLT. \nIRS tax law certified volunteer preparers must prepare tax returns that are within scope of the VITA/ TCE \nprogram. Volunteers must spot out-of-scope returns early in the tax return preparation process. Refer all \nout-of-scope tax returns to a professional tax return preparer. Scope refers to VITA/TCE tax law topics \napplied to a volunteer prepared tax return. Scope does not refer to income levels. A Scope of Service Chart \nis in Publication 4012, VITA/TCE Volunteer Resource Guide.\n•  Tax law instructors must certify in tax law at the Advanced level or higher. \n•  IRS tax law certified volunteer preparers can only prepare returns with tax issues that fall within their \ncertification level. If the site is preparing tax returns above the Basic certification level, the volunteer \npreparer must certify to the level needed to prepare these returns. \n 4\n•  Designated and peer-to-peer quality reviewers can only quality review returns with tax issues that fall \nwithin their certification levels. If the site is preparing tax returns above the Basic certification level, the \nquality reviewers must certify to the level needed to quality review these returns.\nSpecialty Certifications \n•  Volunteers may take other specialty certifications. \n ◦Volunteers must first certify in Volunteer Standards of Conduct before taking Over the Phone Interpreter \n(OPI) certification\n ◦Volunteers must first certify at either Basic or Advanced level before taking the specialty certification for \nPuerto Rico. \n ◦Volunteers must first certify at the Advanced level before taking the Military and International specialty \ncertifications. \n•  Federal Tax Law Update Test for Circular 230 Professionals (C230) - SPEC offers a tax law certification \ntest that allows VITA/TCE volunteers who have the professional designation of attorney, Certified Public \nAccountant (CPA), or Enrolled Agent (EA) to certify on new provisions and tax law changes. Volunteers with \nprofessional designations must have an active license and be in good standing. In addition, the volunteers \nmust first certify in Volunteer Standards of Conduct and Intake/ Interview and Quality Review. The C230 test \nis an optional certification. Volunteers who want more training can choose the traditional certification paths \navailable to all volunteers. \n•  Volunteers who successfully pass the C230 test can prepare all tax returns within the scope of the VITA/\nTCE program. SPEC created the minimum certification requirements for volunteers who are authorized \nunder Circular 230; however, partners may establish additional certification requirements for their \nvolunteers. Volunteers and coordinators should check with the sponsoring SPEC partner.\nVolunteers who certify only in C230 for tax law are not eligible for Continuing Education (CE) credits.\nSPEC requirements may be different from partner requirements. Partners may require a higher level of \ntraining. However, partner requirements can never be lower than IRS requirements. For example, some \npartners require their coordinators to be certified at the Advanced tax law certification level, even if they do not \ngive tax law advice, prepare, or correct tax returns. For example, AARP Foundation Tax-Aide (Tax-Aide) \nrequires tax counselors to certify at the Advanced level. This is an acceptable practice. \nCoordinators and alternate coordinators must complete site coordinator training annually. There are several \noptions for completing site coordinator training: \n•  Attend local territory training sessions scheduled between October and December.\n•  Attend partner-provided training on the topics covered in Publication 5088, VITA/TCE Site Coordinator \nTraining or\n•  Review Publication 5088, which is available on Link & Learn Taxes (LLT)  or IRS.gov.\nQSR #2, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Process\nAll taxpayers using the services offered through the VITA/TCE programs should be confident they are \nreceiving accurate return preparation and quality service. Three vital processes that result in accurate returns \nand quality service are: effective intake, thorough taxpayer interview and quality review of the tax return. All \nsites must use Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, for every tax return prepared by an \nIRS-certified volunteer. Form 13614-C guides the IRS-certified volunteer preparer through the interview with \nthe taxpayer and allows them to gather all necessary information to prepare an accurate return. \nEvery site must use a complete quality review process for all returns prepared to ensure accuracy. A tax \nreturn is considered accurate when tax law is applied correctly, and the completed return is free from error \nbased on the completed Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet (or Form 13614-NR), \nthe taxpayer's interview and the taxpayer’s supporting documentation.  All returns must be quality reviewed \n 5\nand discussed with the taxpayer using the designated or peer-to-peer review. Self Review is not allowed. All \nreturns must be quality reviewed by another volunteer certified to the level required for the return.\nForm 13614-NR, Nonresident Alien Intake and Interview sheet is also available for use at sites \nserving nonresident alien taxpayers. Volunteers are required to be certified in Foreign Student and \nScholar to use this form to prepare Form 1040-NR, US Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return.\nQSR#2 requires a volunteer to have a complete Form 13614-C before preparing each tax return. \nVolunteers must verify each answer on pages 1 through 3.  On pages 2 and 3, confirm each checked \nbox is accurate. If a taxpayer incorrectly checked a box, erase or cross out the box and put your initials.  \nUse the gray shaded column on the right side of pages 2 and 3 to leave notes or  clarify answers. There is \nadditional space for preparer notes on page 5.\nQSR #3, Confirming Photo Identification and Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN)\nCoordinators must have a process in place to confirm taxpayers’ identities and taxpayer identification \nnumbers (TIN). All volunteers must follow the site's process prior to tax return preparation. In addition, the \nquality reviewer must perform the verification procedures again during quality review before taxpayer signs \nand receives a copy of the prepared tax return.\nThis process must include using acceptable documents to confirm taxpayers’ identities and TIN by \nreviewing:\n•  Original photo identification (ID) for the taxpayer (and spouse, if married filing jointly); and \n•  Social Security numbers (SSN) and individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITIN) for everyone listed \non the tax return and\n•  Correct spelling of names for everyone listed on the tax return\nPlease refer to Publication 4299 for more information about acceptable documents for photo identification \nand to confirm a TIN. Publication 4299 provides exceptions for validating taxpayer identities subject to \ncoordinator approval.\nQSR #4, Reference Materials\nAll sites must have, in paper or electronic form, the following reference materials available for use by IRS tax \nlaw certified volunteers: \n•  Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax (For Individuals) \n•  Publication 4012, VITA/TCE Volunteer Resource Guide \n•  Publication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Civil Rights – A Public Trust \n•  Volunteer Tax Alerts (VTA) and Quality Site Requirement Alerts (QSRA) or CyberTax Alerts issued by Tax-\nAide \nQSR #5, Volunteer Agreement\nForm 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement - VITA/TCE Programs. \nAnnually, all volunteers (coordinators, return preparers, quality reviewers, greeters, screeners, client \nfacilitators, etc.) must complete the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) certification. In addition they \nmust agree to follow the VSC by signing and dating Form 13615.\nThe partner’s approving official must also certify (sign and date) Form 13615. This confirms that the \npartner’s approving official has verified the volunteer’s identity, name, and address, using government-\nissued photo identification. The partner must also confirm the volunteer has passed the required IRS \ntraining certification test(s), and the volunteer has signed and dated Form 13615. Every volunteer’s Form \n13615 must be certified prior to their volunteering at a VITA/TCE site. This approving official can be the \ncoordinator, sponsoring partner official, instructor, or IRS contact, as appointed by the partner. \n 6\nThe approving official must confirm volunteers’ identities, names, and addresses using government-issued \nphoto identification (ID), when reviewing and signing Forms 13615. SPEC partners and coordinators can \nreview volunteers’ government-issued photo ID electronically. Government-issued photo identification \n(ID) includes valid driver’s license (U.S.), state ID (U.S.), Military ID, national ID, visa, Global Entry ID, or \npassport. Coordinators can make exceptions to use official high school identification for students taking part \nas volunteers in an official VITA/TCE High School program. The name on Form 13615 must match both \nthe name on the government-issued photo ID and the volunteer’s name added to TaxSlayer or other tax \npreparation software. SPEC does not allow the use of volunteer nicknames in the tax preparation software. \nVolunteers’ names and addresses in LLT must match their government-issued photo ID. Advise \nvolunteers to update their My Account page in LLT with their valid name and address. \nCoordinators must exercise due diligence and have a method to verify training certification the day \nthe volunteer reports to the site. \nThe approving official must confirm volunteers’ identities, names, and addresses using government-issued \nphoto identification (ID), when reviewing and signing Forms 13615. SPEC partners and coordinators can \nreview volunteers’ government-issued photo ID electronically. Government-issued photo identification \n(ID) includes valid driver’s license (U.S.), state ID (U.S.), Military ID, national ID, visa, Global Entry ID, or \npassport. Coordinators can make exceptions to use official high school identification for students taking part \nas volunteers in an official VITA/TCE High School program. The name on Form 13615 must match both \nthe name on the government-issued photo ID and the volunteer’s name added to TaxSlayer or other tax \npreparation software. SPEC does not allow the use of volunteer nicknames in the tax preparation software. \nCoordinators who prepare tax returns, provide tax law assistance, correct rejected returns, or quality \nreview tax returns must certify in tax law to the level required for the complexity of the returns. If they \ndo NOT perform any of these duties, they are not required to certify in tax law, as shown by the dotted line \nin the certification paths chart.\nTax Preparers\nInstructors, Quality \nReviewers\nCoordinators\nCircular 230 \nVolunteers\nAll Other Volunteers\nVolunteer Standards of Conduct Training & Certification\nIntake/Interview and Quality Review Certification\nTax Law Certification\nSite Coordinator \nCertification\nCircular 230 \nCertification*\nSPEC Over-the-\nPhone Interpreter\n(SPEC OPI, optional \ncertification)\n*Federal Tax Law Update Test for Circular 230 Professionals\n 7\nQSR #6, Timely Filing of Tax Returns\nAll coordinators must have a process in place to ensure every tax return is timely electronically filed or \ndelivered to the taxpayer. Refer to Publication 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS e-file Providers of \nIndividual Income Tax Returns, for guidance on e-filing returns, stockpiling of returns and resolving rejects. \nE-filing Returns and Stockpiling of Returns\nStockpiling is waiting more than three calendar days to submit the return once the site has all neces­sary \ntax documents. Tax returns must be e-filed no more than three calendar days after the site has secured all \nnecessary information from the taxpayer and completed all necessary tax preparation steps required to file \nthe taxpayers return electronically.   \nThis means the taxpayer has completed the intake/interview process, provided all necessary tax \ndocuments, completed the Quality Review and has provided consent to the site to e-file the return by \nsigning Form 8879.  Once these steps have been completed, the VITA/TCE site has three calendar days to \ne-file the return.  \n Returns must be completed within a reasonable timeframe. If due to lack of response, delays with \nresolving rejects, signing Form 8879 or volunteer staffing, sites must notify taxpayers that the return \nhas been deactivated in the tax preparation software and to return to the site to pick up their tax \ndocuments. If the taxpayer does not return to the site, per Publication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality, and \nCivil Rights, sites must properly dispose of tax documents including burning or shredding the data.\nExtension to File Returns\nSites can assist taxpayers with filing Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension to File US Individual \nIncome Tax Return, with the consent of the taxpayer and when the facts and circumstances of the \ntaxpayer’s situation indicate filing an extension to file their return is the correct tax determination for the \ntaxpayer.\nIn order to e-file the Form 4868 on behalf of the taxpayer, the Form 8878, IRS E-file Signature Authorization \nfor the Form 4868 or Form 2350 MUST be signed by the taxpayer prior to the e-filing of the Form 4868.\nQSR #7, Civil Rights\nAll VITA/TCE sites must make available to all taxpayers who seek services at the site information on Title \nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by providing the current Publication 4053 (en-sp), Your Civil Rights are \nProtected Poster for IRS Assisted Programs (VITA/TCE/LITC) (English & Spanish), or a current D143, \nAARP Foundation Tax-Aide (poster). \nThese posters provide volunteers and taxpayers with contact information to report discriminatory treatment. \nIf a taxpayer or volunteer has a civil rights complaint, refer them to the contact information on Publication \n4053 (en-sp). If taxpayers request the information in writing, offer Publication 4454, Your Civil Rights are \nProtected. Publication 4454 is an optional brochure designed to notify taxpayers of their civil rights when \nthe site cannot provide tax preparation services (for example, lack of information to prepare the return, the \nreturn is not within scope of the VITA/ TCE program). \nTaxpayers must have access to the civil rights information even if they do not have a tax return \nprepared. At a traditional site, the poster must be visible at the first point of contact between the \ntaxpayer and volunteer. For virtual sites, the poster must be sent or made available to all seeking services. \nQSR #8, Correct Site Identification Number (SIDN)\nAll tax returns prepared by VITA/TCE sites must include the correct site identification number (SIDN). E-file \nadministrators must set tax software defaults to make sure the correct SIDN automatically appears on each \ntax return. Partners or coordinators should work with their local SPEC territory office to make sure they are \nusing the correct SIDN.\n 8\nQSR #9, Correct Electronic Filing Identification Number (EFIN)\nAll tax returns prepared by VITA/TCE sites must include the correct electronic filing identification number \n(EFIN). All partners must use the online IRS e-file application process found in E-Services on IRS.gov to \napply for an EFIN or update an application. A separate EFIN is required for each physical location. E-file \nadministrators should set the tax software defaults to ensure the correct EFIN automatically appears on \nForm 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization.\nQSR #10, Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality\nPublication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Civil Rights - A Public Trust,  is the resource document \nfor guidance on securing and protecting personally identifiable information (PII) shared by taxpayers, \nvolunteers, and partners. A copy (paper or electronic) must be available at the site. Sites must follow all \nsecurity, privacy, and confidentiality guidelines as outlined in Publication 4299.\nAll coordinators must have security procedures in place as described in Publication 4299 for the following \nprocesses: \n•  Preparing an annual security plan to safeguard taxpayer data. Sites can use Form 15272, VITA/ TCE \nSecurity Plan, or a similar document that captures the same information. See note below for more \ninformation on Form 15272. \n•  Protecting all computers with passwords. \n•  Using a hard-wired internet connection or encrypted and password protected wireless internet connection. \n•  Securing computers, printers, and all equipment. \n•  Safeguarding PII at the site by safely storing and/or properly disposing of the information.\n•  Properly securing signatures on IRC Section 7216 required consent notices. \n•  Limiting volunteer access privileges to the tax software based on assigned roles. \n•  Generally restricting volunteer access to the tax software. \n•  Deactivating usernames in the tax software when volunteers quit, resign, or are no longer working at the \nsite. \nFor additional information on Quality Site Requirements, refer to Publication 5166, VITA/TCE \nVolunteer Quality Site Requirements.\nVSC #2 – Do not accept payment, ask for donations, or accept refund payments for federal \nor state tax return preparation from customers.\n“Free” means we do not accept payment for our services from the clients we serve. We do not want to \nconfuse the taxpayer by asking for donations. Donation or tip jars located in the return preparation or \ntaxpayer waiting area are a violation of this standard. Donation or tip jars can be placed in another area \nat the site as long as that area does not give the impression that the site is collecting the funds for return \npreparation. Donation or tip jars cannot be in the entry, waiting, tax preparation, or quality review areas. \nA client may offer payment, but always refuse with a smile and say something like, “Thank you, but \nwe cannot accept payment for our services.” If someone insists, recommend cookies or donuts for the \nsite. Taxpayers can make cash donations to the sponsoring organization, but not in the tax preparation \narea. Refer taxpayers who are interested in making cash donations to the appropriate website or to the \ncoordinator for more information.\nHaving fee-based preparation at the VITA site location while the VITA site is open is like tip jars within \nthe preparation space. This causes confusion to the taxpayer as VITA is advertised as a free service. \nYou finish a time-consuming return and the client is very grateful. On her way out, the client stops by \nand tries to sneak a $20 bill in your pocket, saying, “I would have paid ten times that at the preparer \nacross the street.” Return the money and explain that you cannot accept money for doing taxes.\n 9\nTaxpayers’ federal or state refunds must not be deposited into VITA/TCE volunteers', partners' or any \nassociated organizations' personal or business bank/debit card accounts. VITA/TCE sites must only \nrequest direct deposit of a taxpayer’s refund into accounts bearing the taxpayer’s name.\nSome VITA/TCE sites use employees of the sponsoring organization to prepare tax returns as a part \nof their work duties. This is not considered receiving payment from the customer and is not a violation \nto this VSC.\nVSC #3 – Do not solicit business from taxpayers you help or use the information gained \nabout them (taxpayer information) for any direct or indirect personal benefit for yourself, \nany other specific individual or organization.\nVolunteers must properly use and safeguard taxpayers’ personal information. Volunteers may not use \nconfidential or nonpublic information to engage in financial transactions. They cannot allow improper use of \ntaxpayer information to further their own, another persons' or organizations' private interests.\nSPEC encourages partnering with banks or credit unions to promote unbanked taxpayers to open bank \naccounts. However, sites and volunteers cannot offer clients refund anticipation loans (RAL) or refund \nanticipation checks (RAC) when preparing federal or state tax returns. \nBelow is guidance for banks or credits unions who partner with VITA/TCE:\n•  VITA/TCE coalitions and partners must take steps, so taxpayers clearly understand tax services remain \nfree of cost regardless of whether they sign up for a bank or credit union membership or a refund \nanticipation loan. \n•  Bank or credit union information/enrollment tables must remain in a separate space from tax return \npreparation. \n•  Bank or credit union offerings must be announced using general terms to potential customers separate \nfrom tax return preparation.\n•  Volunteers must not promote bank or credit union services by using information provided by the taxpayer \nto prepare a tax return (such as the taxpayer not having a bank account or the amount of the tax refund). \n•  SPEC encourages VITA/TCE coalitions and partners to reach out and find additional financial institutions \nto offer services at VITA/TCE sites.  To avoid the appearance of endorsement or preferential treatment, \nSPEC recommends giving other financial institutions with similar products with the same or similar terms \nto be present at the location separate from tax return preparation.\n SPEC determined having a representative of a bank or credit union present at the same location as a \nVITA/TCE site but separate from the tax return preparation space is not a violation of VSC #3 even if \nthat bank provides RACs/RALs as part of its overall business.\nThe partner operates a paid tax service in addition to having a VITA site in the same facility. The \nvolunteer reviews the income documents and determine the taxpayer’s total income is above the VITA \nincome limit. The volunteer then directs customers to their paid service for taxpayer convenience, so they do \nnot have to seek services elsewhere. You explain that this is a violation of VSC #3. Partner used taxpayer \ninformation gained during the Intake/Interview process for direct personal benefit to their organization.\nYour primary business includes selling health insurance policies. During the interview, you find out the \ntaxpayer lost access to health insurance in January of the current year. You cannot offer to sell the \ntaxpayer health insurance through your business.\nYou are a volunteer preparer and an accountant. You cannot solicit business from the taxpayer.\nYou are the site’s greeter. Your daughter asks you to take candy orders at the site for her school \nfundraiser. You explain to her that as a VITA/TCE volunteer you cannot solicit personal business.\n 10\nSecuring consent\nThere will be some instances when taxpayers will allow the use of their personal information other than for \nreturn preparation. Under Internal Revenue Code § 7216, all volunteer sites using or disclosing taxpayer \ndata for purposes other than current, prior, or subsequent year tax return preparation must secure a consent \nfrom the taxpayer. There are several types of consents: Global Carry Forward Consent, Relational EFIN \nConsent, and Use and Disclosure Consents. The coordinator will have a process in place if consents are \nrequired at your VITA/TCE site.\nExceptions to required consents\nVolunteer sites that use or disclose the total number of returns (refunds or credits) prepared for their \ntaxpayers at their site (aggregate data) for fundraising, marketing, and publicity are not required to secure \ntaxpayers’ consent. This information cannot include any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as \nthe taxpayer’s name, SSN/ITIN, address or other personal information, and does not disclose information \ncontaining data from fewer than ten tax returns.\nThis exception does not apply to the use or disclosure in marketing or advertising of statistical compilations \ncontaining or reflecting dollar amounts of refunds, credits, rebates, or related percentages. \nIRC 7216(a) – Imposes criminal penalties on tax return preparers who knowingly or recklessly make \nunauthorized disclosures or uses of information furnished in connection with the preparation of an \nincome tax return. A violation of IRC 7216 is a misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of up to one year \nimprisonment or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both, together with the cost of prosecution.\nFor additional information on IRC 7216 required consents, refer to Publication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality, \nand Civil Rights – A Public Trust.\nVSC #4 – Do not knowingly prepare false returns.\nIt is imperative that volunteers correctly apply tax law to the taxpayer’s situation. While it can be a \ntemptation for a volunteer to bend the law to help taxpayers, this will cause problems down the road for the \ntaxpayers. Volunteers must not knowingly prepare false returns.\nTrust in the IRS and the local sponsoring organization is jeopardized when ethical standards are not \nfollowed. Fraudulent returns can result in unwanted taxpayer interaction with the IRS. The taxpayer may be \nrequired to pay additional tax, plus interest and penalties, resulting in an extreme burden. In addition, the \ntaxpayer may seek damages under state or local law from the SPEC partner for the volunteer’s fraudulent \nactions. Even so, the IRS would still seek payment of the additional taxes, interest, and penalties from the \ntaxpayer.\nTo report suspected violations or concerns which you have by emailing SPEC Headquarters at \nts.voltax@irs.gov. The email should include your name, contact number, site name, and a detailed \ndescription of the incident including the individual's full name, date the incident occurred, and the number of \ntaxpayers affected by the violation. \nA volunteer preparer told the taxpayer that cash income does not need to be reported. The return was \ncompleted without the cash income. The volunteer preparer has violated this standard. The quality \nreviewer simply missed this omission and the return was printed, signed, and e-filed. \nThe quality reviewer missed this omission and the return was printed, signed, and e-filed. Since the quality \nreviewer did not knowingly allow this return to be e-filed incorrectly, the quality reviewer did not violate this \nstandard. Do not to confuse an unethical action with a lack of knowledge or a simple mistake.\nA volunteer prepares a fraudulent return by knowingly claiming an ineligible dependent. The taxpayer \nreceived a notice from IRS disallowing the dependent and assessing additional taxes, interest, and \npenalties. The taxpayer may seek money from the SPEC partner, but must still pay the IRS the additional \ntaxes, interest, and penalties. \n 11\nA volunteer prepares a fraudulent return by adding Household Employee Wages that the taxpayer did \nnot earn. The taxpayer received a notice from IRS for additional information needed about the \nearnings that the taxpayer did not have so the IRS corrected the tax return and began assessing additional \ntaxes, interest, and penalties.\nHardship on the taxpayer\nFor a low-income taxpayer, it could be impossible to make full payment and recover from return fraud. If \nfull payment is not received, the taxpayer will receive several collection notices. If full payment is still not \nreceived, the taxpayer will be sent through the IRS collection process. This could also involve the filing of a \ntax lien or a levy (garnishment) on their bank accounts and/or wages. The taxpayer may be eligible for an \ninstallment agreement, but it could take several years to pay the IRS debt.\nA taxpayer’s return fraudulently contains the Earned Income Credit (EIC). The taxpayer has already \nreceived the refund when an audit notice is issued. During the audit, the taxpayer cannot provide \ndocumentation to support the EIC claim.\nThe taxpayer is disallowed $3,000 in EIC and now has a balance due of over $4,000, including penalties \nand interest. This amount reflects only the EIC disallowance. An additional disallowance of the Head of \nHousehold (HOH) filing status and Child Tax Credit (CTC) could generate a balance of over $6,000.\nIdentity Theft\nNationwide, identity theft continues to grow at an alarming rate. Unfortunately, there are instances of \nunscrupulous volunteers using information they have obtained at a VITA/TCE site to steal the identity \nof taxpayers. For example, using a stolen SSN to file a false tax return to obtain a refund is a form of \nidentity theft. Any suspicion of identity theft occurring at a VITA/TCE site must be reported to IRS Criminal \nInvestigation (CI) and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).\nThe IRS considers this a very serious crime and put measures in place to detect possible identity theft \nsituations at VITA/TCE sites. The IRS is continually implementing: new processes for handling returns, \nnew filters to detect fraud, new initiatives to partner with stakeholders, and a continuing commitment to \ninvestigate the criminals who commit these crimes.\nJane, an IRS tax law-certified volunteer, is working at a VITA site on the first day the site is open. She \nhas volunteered to electronically file the tax returns for the site to help out the coordinator. Therefore, \nshe is given the needed permission level in the tax preparation software. \nThat day, Joe, the coordinator, opens the locked VITA file cabinet and discovers an e-file acceptance report \nhe forgot to destroy from the previous year. He asks Jane to take the report down the hall to the shredder \nbecause it has several SSNs listed. Jane puts the report in her purse without Joe’s knowledge.\nLater that night at home, Jane opens the VITA tax preparation software and prepares falsified tax returns \nfor the eight SSNs listed on the report she took from the VITA site that morning. She makes sure the \nreturns all have large refunds. Jane puts her own bank account information in the direct deposit fields and \nelectronically files the returns.\nJane stole the identity of these eight taxpayers by preparing false federal tax returns to steal the refunds.\nSPEC has a system that extracts information pertaining to tax returns filed through the VITA/TCE program \nwhere multiple tax refunds are being deposited into a single bank account. Jane’s actions were reported to \nIRS CI and TIGTA.\nVSC #5 – Do not engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, notoriously disgraceful conduct, \nor any other conduct considered to have a negative effect on the VITA/TCE program.\nSPEC can prohibit volunteers from participating in the VITA/TCE program if they engage in criminal, \ninfamous, dishonest, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, or any other conduct prejudicial to the government. \n 12\nVolunteers must take care to avoid interactions that discredit the program. A taxpayer may look to state or \nlocal law to seek money from the SPEC partner for a volunteer’s fraudulent actions.\nIf you have information indicating that another volunteer has engaged in criminal conduct or violated \nany of the Volunteer Standards of Conduct, immediately report such information to your coordinator \nand email SPEC headquarters at ts.voltax@irs.gov and copy the partner and the local SPEC territory \noffice as appropriate. The email notification should include your name, contact number, site name, and a \ndetailed description of the incident including the individual's full name, date the incident occurred and the \nnumber of taxpayers affected by the violation.\nConsequences\nVolunteers performing egregious activities are barred from volunteering for the VITA/TCE program and may \nbe added to a registry of barred volunteers. \nAllowing an unauthorized alien to volunteer at a VITA/TCE site is prohibited. An “unauthorized alien” \nis defined as a person not lawfully admitted into the United States for either permanent residence or \nemployment. All volunteers participating in the VITA/TCE program must legally reside in the United States. \nCoordinators are required to ask for proof of identity with a government-issued photo ID for each volunteer. \nHowever, coordinators or partners are not required to validate the legal status of volunteers. Therefore, by \nsigning Form 13615, volunteers are certifying that they are legal residents of the United States.\nA partner’s program director was convicted of embezzling funds from an unrelated organization. The \nprogram director’s criminal conduct created negative publicity for the partner. The partner was \nremoved from the VITA/TCE program.\nA taxpayer’s refund was stolen by a volunteer return preparer at a VITA site. The taxpayer sought \nmonetary damages from the SPEC partner for the volunteer’s fraudulent actions. The volunteer \npreparer was banned from volunteering in the VITA/TCE program.\nVSC #6 – Treat all taxpayers in a professional, courteous, and respectful manner.\nTo safeguard public trust, Internal Revenue Service employees, partners, and volunteers must maintain the \nconfidence and respect of the people we serve. All volunteers must conduct themselves professionally in a \ncourteous, businesslike, and diplomatic manner.\nVolunteers take pride in assisting individuals who come to VITA/TCE sites for return preparation. Taxpayers \nare often under a lot of stress and may wait extended periods for assistance. Volunteers may also \nexperience stress due to the volume of taxpayers needing service. This situation can make patience run \nshort. It is important to remain calm and create a peaceful and friendly atmosphere.\nYou finish a difficult return for Millie, who has self-employment income, several expenses, and very \nfew records. In addition, her son turned 25 and moved out early in the year. She owes the IRS about \n$50. After you carefully explain the return, Millie sputters, “You don’t know what you’re doing. I always get a \nrefund! My neighbor is self-employed and she got $1,900 back.” In this situation, you should take a deep \nbreath and courteously explain that every return is different. If necessary, involve the coordinator.\n 13\nTaxpayer Civil Rights\nIn accordance with federal law and the Department of the Treasury – Internal Revenue Service policy, \ndiscrimination against taxpayers on the basis of race, color, national origin (including Limited English \nProficiency), disability, sex (in education programs or activities), age or reprisal is prohibited in programs \nand activities receiving federal financial assistance.\nPersons with disabilities and/or limited English proficiency should be able to participate in or benefit \nfrom programs and services that IRS supports. Taxpayers with a disability may request a reasonable \naccommodation and taxpayers with limited English proficiency may request language assistance to \naccess services. For additional information refer to Publication 4053, Your Civil Rights Are Protected, for \nreasonable accommodations. \nCoordinators at federally assisted sites are responsible for ensuring that reasonable requests for \naccommodation are granted when the requests are made by qualified individuals with disabilities and \nthat reasonable steps are taken to ensure that LEP persons have meaningful access to its programs or \nactivities. For additional guidance, please visit the Site Coordinator Corner on IRS.gov and review the \nFact Sheets on Reasonable Accommodation and Limited English Proficiency.\nIf a taxpayer believes he or she has been discriminated against, a written complaint should be sent to:\nInternal Revenue Service\nCivil Rights Unit\n1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room 2413\nWashington DC 20224\nFor all inquiries concerning taxpayer civil rights, contact the Civil Rights Division at the address \nreferenced above, or email: civil.rights.division@irs.gov\nDo not send returns, payments or other non-civil rights information to this address.\nDue Diligence\nBy law, tax return preparers must exercise due diligence in preparing or assisting in the preparation of \ntax returns. IRS defines due diligence as the degree of care and caution reasonably expected from, and \nordinarily exercised by, a volunteer in the VITA/TCE program. This means, as a volunteer, you must do your \npart when preparing or quality reviewing a tax return to ensure the information on the return is correct and \ncomplete. Doing your part includes confirming a taxpayer’s (and/or spouse, if married filing jointly) identity \nand providing top-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities.\nGenerally, IRS tax law certified volunteers may rely in good faith on information from a taxpayer without \nrequiring documentation as verification. However, part of due diligence requires volunteers to ask \na taxpayer to clarify information that may appear to be inconsistent or incomplete. When reviewing \ninformation for its accuracy, volunteers need to ask themselves if the information is unusual or \nquestionable. \nIf at any time a volunteer becomes uncomfortable with the information provided by the taxpayer, the \nvolunteer should not prepare the tax return. If necessary, ask the coordinator for assistance.\nWhen in doubt, make an effort to find the answer\n•  Seek assistance from the coordinator\n•  Seek assistance from a tax preparer with more experience\n•  Reschedule or suggest the taxpayer come back when a more experienced tax preparer is available\n 14\n•  Reference or research publications (i.e. Publication 17, Publication 4012, Publication 596, etc.)\n•  Research www.irs.gov\n•  Call the VITA/TCE Hotline at 1-800-829-VITA (8482)\n•  Research the Interactive Tax Assistance (ITA) on www.irs.gov to address tax law issues\n•  Advise taxpayers to seek assistance from a professional tax preparer\nFailure to Comply with the Volunteer Standards of Conduct\nWho enforces the standards?\nThe U.S. tax system is based on voluntary compliance. Most taxpayers compute their tax accurately, but at \ntimes unscrupulous taxpayers and preparers evade the system by filing fraudulent returns. For this reason, \nsome sponsoring organizations may perform background checks on their volunteers.\nThe VITA/TCE program is operated by sponsoring partners and/or coalitions outside the IRS. However, IRS \nis responsible for providing oversight to protect the VITA/TCE programs’ integrity and to maintain taxpayer \nconfidence. IRS recognizes the hard work volunteers contribute to the programs and does not want that \novershadowed by a volunteer’s lapse in judgment.\nHow are the standards enforced?\nIRS-SPEC continues to revise Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement, to provide \nguidance to volunteers and a structure for regulating ethical standards. By signing and dating Form 13615, \nVolunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement, volunteers agree that they will adhere to the VSC.\nIf conduct violating the standards occurs at a VITA/TCE site, IRS-SPEC will recommend corrective actions. \nIf the site cannot or will not remedy the conduct, then IRS-SPEC will discontinue its relationship and \nremove any government property from the site.\nIn cases of wrongdoing, illegal conduct, and/or management practices that violate the VSC, IRS-SPEC \nmay terminate a VITA/TCE grant. A volunteer’s conduct could put a site or partner in jeopardy of losing its \ngovernment funding.\nWhat if an unethical situation is discovered at a site?\nIf volunteers, coordinators, or taxpayers identify potential problems at the partner, site, or volunteer level \nthat may require independent scrutiny, they must report these issues using the external referral process \n(VolTax) by emailing SPEC headquarters at ts.voltax@irs.gov. Copy the partner and the local SPEC \nterritory office as appropriate. \nIn general, the coordinator is the first point of contact for resolving any problems that a volunteer may \nencounter. If a volunteer feels an ethical issue can’t be handled by the coordinator, the volunteer \nshould e-mail SPEC headquarters at ts.voltax@irs.gov and copy the partner and the local SPEC territory \noffice as appropriate.\nVolunteer’s role in reporting questionable activity\nHonest taxpayers and tax preparers preserve the tax system’s integrity. To sustain confidence in the VITA/ \nTCE program, you must report violations that raise substantial questions about another volunteer’s honesty, \ntrustworthiness, or fitness as a tax preparer.\nTaxpayers and tax preparers who violate tax law are subject to civil and criminal penalties. Any person who \nknowingly aids, assists, procures, counsels, or advises in the preparation or presentation of a materially false \nor fraudulent return is subject to criminal punishment. IRS-SPEC will refer violations to the IRS CI or TIGTA.\n 15\nCoordinator’s Responsibility\nIf a coordinator determines a volunteer has violated the Volunteer Standards of Conduct, the coordinator \nneeds to immediately remove the volunteer from all site activities and deactivate their access to tax \npreparation software. In addition, notify both the partner and IRS-SPEC with the details of the violation. The \ncoordinator can notify IRS-SPEC by either contacting their local SPEC territory office or using the external \nreferral process (VolTax). If the coordinator contacts the territory, the territory will use the internal referral \nprocess to elevate the referral to headquarters.\nIt is critical that SPEC headquarters be notified as quickly as possible of any potential misconduct by any \nvolunteers to preserve the integrity of the VITA/TCE programs.\nWhile reading the newspaper, Violet, the coordinator at Pecan Public Library, learns that one of her \nvolunteers, Dale, was arrested for identity theft. The article indicates Dale has been using other \npeople’s identities to apply for credit cards and then using these cards for unauthorized purchases. Violet \nsends an email to ts.voltax@irs.gov with the details from the news article and deactivates Dale’s access \nto the tax preparation software. When the site opens the next day, Violet pulls Dale aside and advises him \nthat he cannot work at the site due to his arrest on identity theft charges.\nExternal Referral Process\nIf an unethical situation is discovered the external referral process (VolTax) provides taxpayers, volunteers, \ncoordinators, and others an avenue to report potential unethical problems encountered at VITA/TCE sites. \nVolunteers and taxpayers can send an email to SPEC headquarters ts.voltax@irs.gov and copy the \npartner and the local SPEC territory office as appropriate. The email notification should include your name, \ncontact number, site name, and a detailed description of the incident including the individual's full name, \ndate the incident occurred and the number of taxpayers affected by the violation if applicable.\nThe email address is available in:\n•  Publication 4836 (en-sp), VITA/TCE Free Tax Programs (English & Spanish)\n•  Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet\n•  Publication 730 (en-sp), Important Tax Records-Envelope (English & Spanish Version)\nAll VITA and TCE sites are required to display Publication 4836 (en-sp), or D-143 for AARP sites, in a \nvisible location to ensure taxpayer awareness of the ability to make a referral.\nIt is critical that volunteers and taxpayers immediately report any suspicious or questionable behavior. The \nIRS will investigate the incidents reported to the email address to determine what events occurred and \nwhat actions need to be taken. In addition, your reported violations should be shared with your sponsoring \npartner and local SPEC territory office.\nTaxpayers and tax preparers who violate tax law are subject to civil and criminal penalties. Any person who \nwillfully aids or assists in, procures, counsels, or advises the preparation of a false or fraudulent return is \nsubject to criminal punishment.\nVolunteer Registry\nVolunteers and partners released from the VITA/TCE program for egregious actions and willful violations \nof the Volunteer Standards of Conduct, can be added to the IRS-SPEC Volunteer Registry. The IRS-SPEC \ndirector will determine if a volunteer or partner should be added to the registry. The purpose of the registry \nis to notify IRS-SPEC employees of volunteers and partners who were removed from the VITA/TCE \nprogram. The registry will include partner or individual names, locations, and affiliated agency or sponsors. \nVolunteers and/or partners on this list are unable to participate in VITA/TCE program indefinitely. Egregious \nactions include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following willful actions:\n 16\n•  Creating harm to taxpayers, volunteers or IRS employees\n•  Refusing to adhere to all Quality Site Requirements\n•  Accepting payments for return preparation at VITA/TCE sites\n•  Using taxpayer personal information for personal gain\n•  Knowingly preparing false returns\n•  Engaging in criminal, infamous, dishonest, notorious, disgraceful conduct\n•  Any other conduct considered to have a negative impact on the VITA/TCE program\nWhat is the impact on VITA/TCE programs?\nUnfortunately, one volunteer’s unethical behavior can cast a cloud of suspicion on the VITA/TCE program \nas a whole. IRS-SPEC has closed tax sites due to unethical behavior, which left taxpayers without access \nto free tax preparation in their community. The consequences to the tax site or sponsoring organization may \ninclude:\n•  Removal from all VITA/TCE programs;\n•  Inclusion in the IRS Volunteer Registry to bar future VITA/TCE activity indefinitely;\n•  Deactivation of your sponsoring partner's site EFIN;\n•  Removal of all IRS products, supplies, loaned equipment, and taxpayer information from your site;\n•  Termination of your sponsoring organization's partnership with the IRS;\n•  Termination of grant funds from the IRS to your sponsoring partner; \n•  Referral of your conduct for potential TIGTA and criminal investigations;\n•  Disallowing use of IRS logos; and\n•  Holding partner responsible for stolen refunds or other losses due to fraudulent acts at a site.\nWhat is the impact on taxpayers?\nA taxpayer is responsible for paying only the correct amount of tax due under the law. Although a return is \naccepted, it may not be accurate. Acceptance merely means the required fields are complete and that no \nduplicate returns exist. However, an incorrect return can cause a taxpayer financial stress.\nIt is imperative to correctly apply the tax laws to the taxpayer’s situation. While a volunteer may be tempted \nto bend the law to help taxpayers, this will cause problems in the future.\nHow might the taxpayer find relief?\nIf tax collection would cause significant hardship, the taxpayer may be able to find relief. Significant hardship \nmeans serious deprivation, not simply economic or personal inconvenience to the taxpayer. Although, \ncollection action may stop, interest and penalties will continue to accrue until the balance is paid in full.\nTaxpayers can be referred to Low Income Tax Clinic (LITC) and Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS). LITCs \nare organizations that represent and advocate for taxpayers who have tax problems with the IRS, who's \nincomes are below a certain level. TAS can help you if your tax problem is causing a financial hardship or a \nsystemic issue.\nWhat if the taxpayer is not telling the truth?\nA volunteer who senses that a taxpayer is not telling the truth should not ignore it. Conduct a thorough \ninterview to ensure there is no misunderstanding. If that does not resolve the matter, refer the taxpayer to \nthe coordinator. Remember, if a volunteer is not comfortable with the information provided from the taxpayer, \nthe volunteer is not obligated to prepare the return.\n 17\nTaxpayer review and acknowledgment\nAfter the return is completed, an IRS tax law-certified volunteer must discuss the filing status, dependents, \nincome, adjusted gross income, credits, taxes, payments, and the refund or balance due with the taxpayer. \nThe volunteer must address any taxpayer questions and concerns about the return. If necessary, ask the \ncoordinator for assistance.\nTax returns include the following disclosure statements:\n•  For the Taxpayer: “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this return and \naccompanying schedules and statements, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, they are true, \ncorrect, and complete.”\n•  For the Preparer: “Declaration of preparer (other than the taxpayer) is based on all information of which \npreparer has any knowledge.”\nVolunteers must remind taxpayers that when they sign the return (either by signing Form 1040, U.S. \nIndividual Income Tax Return or signing Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization), they are \nstating under penalty of perjury that the return is accurate to the best of their knowledge.\nVolunteer Protection Act\nPublic Law 105-19, Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 (VPA) generally protects volunteers from liability for \nnegligent acts they perform within the scope of their responsibilities in the organization for whom they \nvolunteer. The VPA is not owned or written exclusively for Internal Revenue Service. This is a public law \nand relates to organizations that use volunteers to provide services.\nWhat is a volunteer?\nUnder the VPA, a “volunteer” is an individual performing services for a nonprofit organization or a \ngovernmental entity (including as a director, officer, trustee, or direct service volunteer) who does not \nreceive for these services more than $500 total in a year from the organization or entity as:\n•  Compensation (other than reasonable reimbursement or allowance for expenses actually incurred), or\n•  Any other thing of value in lieu of compensation\nAlthough an individual may not fall under the VPA definition of a “volunteer,” which means they may not \nbe protected under the VPA, they are still considered volunteers by the VITA/TCE program. To ensure \nprotection, those who do not fit this VPA volunteer definition should seek advice from their sponsoring \norganization’s attorneys to determine liability protection rights.\nWhat does the VPA do?\nThe purpose of the VPA is to promote the interests of social service program beneficiaries and taxpayers \nand to sustain the availability of programs, nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities that depend \non volunteer contributions. It does this by providing certain protections from liability concerns for volunteers \nserving nonprofit organizations and governmental entities.\nThe VPA protects volunteers from liabilities if they were acting within the scope of the program and harm \nwas not caused by willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, conscious, \nflagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer. The VPA does \nnot protect conduct that is willful or criminal, grossly negligent, reckless, or conduct that constitutes a \nconscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer.\nVolunteers must only prepare returns that are within their tax law certification level, their site’s certification \nlevel, and the level of certification under the VITA/TCE program. See the Scope of Service Chart in \nPublication 4012 for more information.\n 18\nIn general, if volunteers are performing their responsibilities while adhering to the Volunteer Standards \nof Conduct, they are protected. However, local and state laws still must be considered. Sponsoring \norganizations should seek advice from their attorneys to determine how this law protects their volunteers.\nInstructions for Completing Training, Certifications, and the VSC Agreement\nAll volunteers are required to register and certify via Link & Learn Taxes (LLT). Volunteers must generate \nthe Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement and provide to their Site Coordinator prior to \nvolunteering. When the volunteer signs Form 13615, they are agreeing to adhere to the VSC. Form 13615 is \nalso used to capture the volunteer's certification level. Form 13615 is not valid until it is signed and dated by \nthe sponsoring partner, coordinator, instructor, or IRS contact, after verifying the volunteer’s identity, name \nand address (with government-issued photo ID) and certification level. Instructors can retrieve the Test \nAnswer Key from LLT after completing their own certification. See the course introductions in Publication \n4491, VITA/TCE Training Guide, or LLT for more information on the certification levels and process.\nNew volunteers must review the VSC training prior to taking the certification test. The VSC training is in \nPublication 4961, VITA/TCE Volunteer Standards of Conduct - Ethics Training. Volunteers must pass the VSC \ncertification test with a score of 80% or higher. The VSC Test is an annual requirement. Volunteers can use \nForm 6744, VITA/TCE Volunteer Assistor’s Test/Retest, as a tool to prepare for the certification test.\nVolunteers may view training by using:\n•  Link & Learn Taxes (LLT) (preferred), OR\n•  The following products, available for download at www.irs.gov:\n ◦Publication 4961, VITA/TCE Volunteer Standards of Conduct – Ethics Training\n ◦Form 6744, VITA/TCE Volunteer Assistor's Test/Retest \nVolunteers who prefer to take the Certification Test on paper utilizing Form 6744, VITA/TCE Volunteer \nAssistor’s Test or Retest, may continue to complete the test using that method but must transcribe their \nanswers to the Test in LLT.\nThe Volunteer Standards of Conduct requirements are in addition to the tax law certification process \nto become a certified volunteer instructor, preparer and quality reviewer.\nNew volunteers are required to view the VSC Training before taking the VSC certification test. In \naddition, volunteers assigning tax returns and new volunteers planning to be a coordinator or hold a \nposition requiring tax law certification are also required to view the Intake/Interview and Quality Review \nTraining before taking the associated certification test. All coordinators and alternate coordinators are now \nrequired to certify by passing the Site Coordinator Test with a score of 80% or higher prior to working at a \nsite. The Site Coordinator test is available on LLT.",

If a volunteer feels an ethical issue can’t be handled by the coordinator, the volunteer should \nemail SPEC headquarters at ts.voltax@irs.gov and copy the partner and the local SPEC territory office \nas appropriate. The email notification should include your name, contact number, site name, and a detailed \ndescription of the incident including the individuals full name, date the incident occurred and the number of \ntaxpayer's affected by the violation if applicable. The following chart lists common issues that a taxpayer \nmay have and where they can be referred. Publication 5136, IRS Services Guide, also may be helpful \nwhen a taxpayer has a question unrelated to tax preparation. Publication 5136 can be located at www.irs.\ngov/pub/irs-pdf/p5136.pdf. \nFor this type of issue:\nThe appropriate action is:\nIndividual or company is \nviolating the tax laws\nUse Form 3949-A, Information Referral.

She completes Form 13614-C, \nIntake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet. She indicates on page 2 of Form 13614-C that she has \nself-employment income along with other income and expenses.\nJoe, a volunteer tax preparer, reviews Form 13614-C with Edna. He asks if she brought all of her \ndocuments today, and asks to see them. Included in the documents is Form 1099-NEC, Nonemployee \nCompensation, showing $7,500 of non-employee compensation in Box 1. She tells Joe that she has a \ncleaning business that provides services to local businesses.\nEdna says she also received $4,000 in cash payments for additional cleaning work. When Joe asks if she \nreceived any documentation supporting these payments, she says no, the payments were simply paid to \nher for each cleaning job she performed.\nJoe suggests because the IRS has no record of the cash payments, Edna does not need to report these \npayments on her return. Edna is concerned and feels like she could “get in trouble” with the IRS if she does \nnot report all of her income. Joe assures her that the chance of the IRS discovering that she did not report \ncash income is very small.\nJoe prepares Form 1040, Individual Income Tax Return. On Schedule C, Line 1 he reports only the $7,500 \nreported in Box 1 of Form 1099-NEC. When Joe completes the return and after the quality review has been \ncompleted, he hands it to Edna to sign Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization.\na. Is there a Volunteer Standards of Conduct violation? If yes, identify which VSC and describe.\nb. What should the volunteer have done?\nc. What could happen to the volunteer?\nQuestion 2: Taxpayer George completes Form 13614-C indicating on page 1 that his marital status is \nsingle with one dependent, Amelia. Volunteer preparer Marge reviews the intake form and the taxpayer’s \ninformation documents.\nWhen Marge asks if Amelia is related to George, he says no, that Amelia is the child of a personal friend \nwho is not filing a tax return. Amelia’s mother told George to claim the child and even gave him Amelia’s \nSocial Security card. Marge then asks whether George provided more than one-half of Amelia’s support, \nbut George says no. He goes on to say that he should be able to claim Amelia as a dependent because no \none else is claiming her.\nMarge agrees that although Amelia is not George’s qualifying child or relative, he can still claim her as a \ndependent because no one else will. Marge goes on to suggest that the child could be listed as George’s \nniece who lives with him, so that he can file as a Head of Household and claim the Earned Income Credit \n(EIC). Marge completes Form 13614-C, page 1, accordingly.\nMarge assures George that chances of the IRS discovering that he and Amelia are not related would be \nvery small. Marge prepares the return with the Head of Household status and claiming the EIC and Child \nTax Credits for “qualifying child” Amelia. George signs Form 8879.\na. Is there a Volunteer Standards of Conduct violation? If yes, identify which VSC and describe.\nb. What should the volunteer have done?\nc. What could happen to the volunteer?\nQuestion 3: Taxpayer Isabel’s completed Form 13614-C indicates that she does not have an account to \ndirect deposit a refund. When volunteer James prepares Isabel’s return, it shows that Isabel is entitled to a \n$1,200 refund.\n 21\nJames tells Isabel that a paper check may take up to 6 weeks to arrive, but if she has the funds directly \ndeposited to a checking account, the amount would be available in up to 21 business days. He offers to \nhave the money deposited to his own checking account, stating that on receipt of the money he would turn \nit over to her. Isabel agrees and allows James to enter his routing number and account information on her \nreturn. James gives the money to Isabel when he receives it.\na. Is there a Volunteer Standards of Conduct violation? If yes, identify the VSC and describe.\nb. What should the volunteer have done? \nQuestion 4: While volunteer Lily is completing Ryan’s return, she notes that he is single and asks him if he \nwould like to meet some evening at a local bar so they could get to know each other better. Although Ryan \nsays that he would prefer that she not call him, Lily says she does not give up that easily and that she will \ncall him later in the week.\nRyan reports the conversation to the coordinator before he leaves the site.\na. Is there a Volunteer Standards of Conduct violation? If yes, identify the VSC and describe.\nb. What could happen to the volunteer?\nQuestion 5: Volunteer John is preparing a return for taxpayer Max, who sold stock during the tax year. \nMax says he does not want to report capital gains and tells John that the cost basis on the stock sold was \nequal to or higher than the sales price. Based on his own stock portfolio, John believes Max is lying. John \nexplains to Max that if the IRS examines the return, the cost basis will have to be supported by written \nstatements or other documents of the purchases. Max says he understands, but he still wants the return \ncompleted with the amounts he has given to John. After John completes the return and Max signs Form \n8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization, the return is e-filed.\na. Is there a Volunteer Standards of Conduct violation? If yes, identify the VSC and describe.\nb. What could happen to the volunteer?\nQuestion 6: When Joelle, coordinator, returns from a lunch break, she notices the waiting area is nearly \nempty. When she asks Greeter Jade what happened, Jade says that volunteer Nathan and a taxpayer had \na loud, bitter argument, and many taxpayers got concerned and left. \nJoelle takes Nathan to a private area and asks him to explain what happened. Nathan says the taxpayer \nbecame upset when Nathan told him that as a noncustodial parent he had to have a signed Form 8332, \nRelease/Revocation of Release of Claim to Exemption for Child By Custodial Parent, or he could not claim \nhis children as dependents. Nathan admits that he got angry when the taxpayer started name calling. \nNathan says he told the taxpayer, “If you don’t like our free service, then you can go somewhere else.” \nNathan also says there was a lot of yelling and cussing on both sides and then the taxpayer left the site.\na. Is there a Volunteer Standards of Conduct violation? If yes, identify the VSC and describe.\nb. What should the volunteer have done?\nc. What could happen to the volunteer?\n 22\nSummary\n•  VSC #1 and VSC #3 were updated based on findings from FSV, RSR and QSS reviews.\n•  All volunteers must agree to the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) outlined on Form 13615. The \npartner-designated official or coordinator must verify the identity, name and address (with government- \nissued photo identification) and certification level of the volunteer before the volunteer is allowed to work \nat the site.\n•  Failure to comply with the standards may adversely affect the taxpayer, the site, the partner and the VITA/\nTCE program.\n•  Violations of the VSC will not be tolerated. If a violation is discovered, appropriate actions will be taken, \nup to removal of the volunteer, potential removal from the VITA/TCE program indefinitely, closing of the \nsite, and discontinuing IRS support to the sponsoring partner.\n•  The Volunteer Protection Act generally protects volunteers from liability as long as they are acting in \naccordance with the standards.\n•  Volunteers and partners with questions about the standards should contact their local SPEC territory \noffice.\n•  SPEC requires all instructors, coordinators, client facilitators, return preparers, quality reviewers and any \nvolunteer assisting taxpayers in completing Form 13614-C and/or assigning tax returns to preparers to \npass the Intake/Interview and Quality Review test.\n 23\nExercise Answers\nAnswer 1\na. Yes, VSC #4 knowingly preparing a fraudulent return. Joe knowingly did not include the cash \npayments that Edna received.\nb. Cash income should have been reported as income on Schedule C.\nc. Volunteer should be removed and barred from working at a VITA/TCE site and added to the Volunteer \nRegistry.\nAnswer 2\na. Yes, VSC #4, knowingly preparing a fraudulent return. Although the taxpayer insisted on including the \ndependent, Marge knew this was wrong.\nb. Volunteer should have educated George on dependent eligibility using Publication 4012, Volunteer \nResource Guide, refuse to prepare the tax return, or report the incident to the coordinator.\nc. Volunteer should be removed and barred from working at a VITA/TCE site and added to the volunteer \nregistry.\nAnswer 3\na. Yes, VSC #2, do not accept payment, ask for donations, or accept refund payments for federal or \nstate tax return preparation. Although the volunteer’s intention was to help Isabel get her refund \nsooner by having it direct deposited instead of mailed, putting it into his own account is problematic \nand could raise the question of misappropriation of a tax refund or be perceived as receiving payment \nfor tax return preparation. Generally, VITA/TCE volunteers should only request direct deposit of a \ntaxpayer’s refund into accounts bearing the taxpayer’s name.\nb. The volunteer should have suggested that the taxpayer open an account and provide the routing and \naccount number. He should have never offered to deposit funds into his own account.\nc. Volunteer must be counseled that he cannot put any other taxpayer’s refund into his own account. If \nthis continues, he will be removed and barred from the site.\nAnswer 4\na. Yes, VSC #3. Volunteers should not use information gained from the taxpayer for their personal \nbenefit or the benefit of a specific individual or organization. \nb. Lily should be reminded that she cannot use taxpayer’s personal information (marital status and \nphone number) for her benefit.\nAnswer 5\na. Maybe. Even though Max insists on using the cost basis he provides to John, as long as John \nhas conducted a thorough interview, especially about the stock sales, he can prepare the return. \nJohn should remind Max that taxpayers sign their returns under penalty of perjury, and that Max is \nultimately responsible for the return. If Max tells John that the basis amounts are wrong and John \nprepares the return anyway, then John is violating VSC #4, knowingly preparing a false return.\nb. As long as John did not knowingly prepare a false return, nothing should happen. However, if John \ndoes know the information is false, then he should be removed, barred from the site, and he could be \nadded to the Volunteer Registry.\nAnswer 6\na. Yes, VSC #6. Volunteers must deal with people at the site with courtesy and in a respectful and \nprofessional manner.\nb. Nathan should have taken a deep breath and courteously explained the Form 8332 requirements \nusing Publication 4012. If the situation still could not be resolved, Nathan should have requested the \ntaxpayer speak to the coordinator upon her return.\nc. Nathan should be warned that future outbursts will result in his immediate removal as a volunteer.\n 24\nForm 13615 \n 25\nForm 13615\n 26\nLink & Learn Taxes\nLink & Learn Taxes is web-based training designed specifically for VITA/TCE volunteers. Each volunteer’s ability to \nprepare complete and accurate returns is vital to the credibility and integrity of the program. Link & Learn Taxes, as part \nof the complete volunteer training kit, provides the path to achieving this high level of quality service.\nLink & Learn Taxes and Publication 4012, VITA/TCE Volunteer Resource Guide, work together to help volunteers learn \nand practice.\nLink & Learn Taxes for 2024 includes:\n•\t Access to all VITA/TCE courses\n•\t Easy identification of the VITA/TCE courses with the course icons\n\t◦As you progress through a lesson, the content for Basic, Advanced, Military, or International will display, \ndepending on the level of certification you selected\n•\t PowerPoint presentations that can be customized to fit your classroom needs\n•\t VITA/TCE Central to provide centralized access for certification, training materials, and reference links\n•\t The Practice Lab\n\t◦Gives volunteers practice with an early version of the IRS-provided tax preparation software\n\t◦Lets volunteers complete sample practice problems\n\t◦Lets volunteers prepare test scenario returns for the test/retest\nGo to https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/.
