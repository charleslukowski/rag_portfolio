The estimates \npresented here are based on returns filed in Processing Year \n2023 that were sampled statistically and then weighted to \nestimate the entire 2022 Tax Year.\nFor each information return, we provide three sets of counts. \nThese include frequencies per form line entry, number of \nindividuals per form line entry, and total amount per form line \nentry. The frequencies per form line entry were computed by \nselecting all information returns filed, excluding those returns \nthat were filed in duplicate or were corrected by a subsequently \nfiled amended return. The number of individuals per form line \nentry was computed by aggregating frequencies per form line \nentry to the individual level, as several information returns can \nbe filed on behalf of a single individual. The amounts represent \nthe dollar sum in thousands of dollars reported for each line \nitem.\t\t\nSuggested Citation\nStatistics of Income—2022\nIndividual Information Returns\nLine Item Estimates\nInternal Revenue Service\nWashington, D.C.\n1\nDescription of the Sample\nfor the Line Item Estimates\nThis section describes the domain of the study, the \nsample design and selection, data capture and cleaning, \nthe method of estimation, and the sampling variability \nof the estimates.\nDomain of Study \nThe statistics in this report are estimates from a \nprobability sample of Individual Information Returns, \nfiled during Calendar Year 2023 by third parties about \ncertain business and money transactions on behalf \nof U.S. citizens and residents that were selected \nfor inclusion in the sample of unaudited Individual \nIncome Tax Returns, Form 1040 (including electronic \nreturns), and being reported as a dependent on a \nselected Tax Return, or if the citizen or resident for \nwhich the information return was filed possesses \ncertain combinations of the four ending digits of the \nsocial security number (SSN) but no Tax Return was \nfiled. To avoid double counting, information returns \nassociated with dependent tax returns were excluded \nbecause they were instead included in association with \ntheir parents returns.\nAll returns processed during 2023 were subjected \nto sampling except tentative and amended returns. \nTentative returns were not subjected to sampling \nbecause the revised returns may have been sampled \nlater, while amended returns were excluded because \nthe original returns had already been subjected to \nsampling. A small percentage of returns were not \nidentified as tentative or amended until after sampling. \nThese returns were excluded in the selection of the \nInformation Returns sample and in calculating \nestimates.\nThe estimates in this report are intended to represent \nall Information Returns filed for Tax Year 2022. While \nmost of the returns processed during Calendar Year \n2023 were filed for Tax Year 2022, a small portion of \nreturns were for prior years.\nSample Design and Selection \nThe sample design is a stratified probability sample \nin which the population of tax returns is classified \ninto subpopulations, called strata, and an independent \nsample is randomly selected from each stratum. Strata \nare defined by the following characteristics: \n1.\t Nontaxable (including no alternative minimum tax) \nwith adjusted gross income or expanded income of \n$200,000 or more. \n2.\tHigh business receipts of $50,000,000 or more. \n3.\t Presence or absence of special forms or schedules \n(Form 2555, Form 1116, Form 1040 Schedule C, and \nForm 1040 Schedule F). \n4.\tIndexed positive or negative income. Sixty variables \nare used to derive positive and negative incomes. \nThese positive and negative income classes are de­\nflated using the Chain-Type Price Index for the Gross \nDomestic Product to represent a base year of 2016. \nTax data processed to the IRS Individual \nMaster File at the Enterprise Computing Center \nat Martinsburg during Calendar Year 2023 were \nused to assign each taxpayer’s record to the \nappropriate stratum and to determine whether the \nrecord should be included in the sample. Records \nare selected for the sample either if they possess \ncertain combinations of the four ending digits of \ntheir Social Security number (SSN), or if their five \nending digits of an eleven-digit number generated \nby a mathematical transformation of the SSN is less \nthan or equal to the stratum sampling rate times \n100,000.\nThe portion of the sample covering those with \nno filed tax return is designed as a simple random \nsample of recipients of information returns \npossessing certain combinations of the four ending \ndigits of the SSN.\n2\nData Capture and Cleaning \nData capture for the SOI sample begins with the \ndesignation of a sample of administrative records. \nWhile the sample was being selected, the process was \ncontinually monitored for sample selection and data \ncollection errors.\nThe administrative data and controlling information \nfor each record designated for this sample were \nthen run through an automated corrections process. \nThe process resolves inconsistencies resulting from \nduplicated filings and replaces erroneous returns with \nfiled amended returns.\nMethod of Estimation \nWeights were obtained by dividing the population \ncount of returns in a stratum by the number of sampled \nreturns for that stratum. The weights were adjusted to \ncorrect for misclassified returns and were then applied \nto the sample data to produce all the estimates in this \nreport.\nFor returns having no matching tax return, weights \nwere obtained by calculating the inverse of the \nsampling share (10 in 9,999).\nSampling Variability \nThe sample used in this study is one of a large number \nof samples that could have been selected using the \nsame sample design. The estimates calculated from \nthese different samples would vary. The standard error \nof an estimate is a measure of the variation among the \nestimates from the possible samples and, thus, is a \nmeasure of the precision with which an estimate from \na particular sample approximates the average of the \nestimates calculated from all possible samples.\n3\n     \nForm 1099-K\n(Rev.
