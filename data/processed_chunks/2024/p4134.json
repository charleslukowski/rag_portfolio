LITCs can represent taxpayers in federal courts, as well as before the IRS. In addition, LITCs can\nprovide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak English \nas a second language (ESL). LITCs receive grants from the IRS but are independent organizations. Before selecting a\ntax professional, taxpayers should ask questions to ensure that the professional they select to help them has the\nexpertise needed to resolve their tax problem.\nWho is Eligible to Receive Assistance? \n•\nGenerally, taxpayers whose incomes do not exceed 250% of the federal poverty guidelines may qualify for assistance.\nContact the LITC nearest you to find out if you meet income and other eligibility requirements.\nWhere is the Nearest LITC? \n•\nThis publication includes contact information for LITCs and is available online at: www.irs.gov or by calling the IRS at:\n1-800-829-3676. For the most current information, please see the “Find your local clinic” search tool at the bottom\nof the LITC page at: www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/litc. Please note the location listed is the main office and many\nclinics have additional office locations. Please call the clinic if you would like to find out about additional locations.\nWhat is the ESL Education Pilot Program? \n•\nThe ESL Education Pilot Program funds clinics to educate individuals for whom English is a second language about\ntheir taxpayer rights and responsibilities. Each clinic participating (identified below as an \"ESL Pilot Clinic\") is funded\nsolely to provide ESL education but may also offer some limited tax consultation services to individual taxpayers.\n2025 LITCs and Contact Information \nState \nCity \nClinic Name \nPublic \nPhone Number \nLanguages  \nServed in Addition to English \nAK \nAnchorage \nAlaska Business Development Center LITC \n800-478-3474 \n907-562-0335 \nAll languages through interpreter services \nAL \nMontgomery \n \nLegal Services Alabama LITC \n866-456-4995 \n334-832-4570 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nAR \nLittle Rock \nUA Little Rock Bowen School of Law LITC \n501-916-5492 \nSpanish  \nSpringdale \nLegal Aid of Arkansas LITC \n870-732-6373 \nSpanish and Marshallese \n \nAZ \nFlagstaff \nDNA People’s Legal Services LITC \n833-362-1102 \nSpanish, Navajo, Hopi, and other languages \nthrough interpreter services \nPhoenix \nCommunity Legal Services LITC \n800-852-9075 \n602-258-3434 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nTucson \nSouthern Arizona Tax Clinic \n520-622-2801 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nCA \nLos Angeles \nBet Tzedek Legal Services Tax Clinic \n323-939-0506 \nSpanish, Russian, and other languages \nthrough interpreter services \nLos Angeles \nKYCC Low Income Taxpayer Clinic \n213-365-7400\nSpanish and Korean \nLos Angeles \nPepperdine LITC \n213-673-4831 \nSpanish \nMerced \nUnited Way of Merced County \nESL Pilot Clinic \n209-384-1329 \nSpanish \nNorthridge \nBookstein Low Income Taxpayer Clinic \n818-677-3688 \nSpanish, Armenian, Tagalog, and Hindi \nNorthridge \nThe Taxpayers Help Center Low Income Taxpayer Clinic \n818-488-1388 \nSpanish, Hindi, and Urdu \nOrange \nChapman University Tax Law Clinic \n877-242-7529\n714-628-2535 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nRiverside \nInland Counties Legal Services LITC \n888-245-4257 \n951-368-2555 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nSan Diego \nLegal Aid Society of San Diego LITC \n877-534-2524 \nSpanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Arabic, Farsi, \nand Somali \nSan Diego \nUniversity of San Diego LITC \n619-260-7470 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nSan Francisco \nChinese Newcomers Service Center \n415-421-2111 \nChinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese, \nand Toisanese \nSan Francisco \nJustice and Diversity Center of the Bar Association of \nSan Francisco \n415-782-8978 \nSpanish \nSan Francisco \nUC Law SF LITC  \n415-703-8287 \nSpanish \nSan Gabriel \nHerald Community Center \n626-286-2600 \nMandarin and Cantonese \nSan Luis \nObispo \nCal Poly Low Income Taxpayer Clinic \n877-318-6772      \n805-756-2951 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nSanta Ana \nPublic Law Center \n888-230-3741 \n714-541-1010 \nSpanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Chinese, \nArabic, Farsi, and Mandarin \n \nCO \nDenver \nColorado Legal Services LITC \n844-440-4848 \n303-837-1313 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nDenver \nDenver Asset Building Coalition LITC \n303-388-7030 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nDenver \nUniversity of Denver LITC \n303-871-6331 \nSpanish \nCT \n \nHamden \nQuinnipiac University School of Law LITC \n203-582-3238 \nSpanish and other languages through \ninterpreter services \nHartford \nUConn Law School Tax Clinic \n860-570-5165 \nSpanish, Mandarin, Chinese, French, and \nother languages through interpreter services \nDC \n \nWashington \nAmerican University Washington College of Law,  \nJanet R.
