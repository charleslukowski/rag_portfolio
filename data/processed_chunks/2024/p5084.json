File promptly to minimize \ninterest and penalties \nIRS encourages taxpayers who missed the filing deadline to submit their tax return as soon as \npossible. Those who missed the deadline to file but owe taxes should file timely to avoid \nadditional penalties and interest. \nTaxpayers should keep in mind that requesting an extension allows for additional time to file but \nnot to pay taxes owed. Individuals who owe taxes should file their tax return and pay as soon as \nthey can. Interest and penalties will continue to accrue on the owed taxes until the balance is \npaid in full. \nFile and pay to limit penalties and interest \nEven if a taxpayer cannot afford to immediately pay the full amount of taxes owed, they should \nstill file a tax return and pay as much as possible. The IRS offers options for taxpayers who \nneed help paying their tax bill. For more information, visit the Penalties page on IRS.gov. \nTaxpayers may qualify for penalty relief if they have filed and paid timely for the past three \nyears and meet other important requirements. For more information, see the Administrative \nPenalty Relief page on IRS.gov. \n2 \nBack to Top \nIndividuals can pay taxes owed securely through IRS Online Account, IRS Direct Pay, The \nElectronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), debit or credit card or digital wallet. \nTaxpayers may also apply online for a payment plan (including installment agreements). \nThose who pay electronically get immediate confirmation after submitting payment. Direct Pay \nand the EFTPS allow taxpayers to receive payment email notifications. Find additional payment \ninformation at Make a Payment on IRS.gov. \nDue for a refund? Don’t overlook filing a tax return \nThere's no penalty for filing after the April 15 deadline if a refund is due. Every year, the IRS \nestimates nearly a million taxpayers who failed to file prior year tax returns are potentially due \nrefund money. \nTaxpayers who choose not to file a return because they don't earn enough to meet the filing \nrequirement may miss out on receiving a refund due to potential refundable tax credits. \nExamples include the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. Taxpayers sometimes \nfail to file a tax return and claim a refund for these credits and others for which they may be \neligible. \nTaxpayers can track their refund using the Where's My Refund? tool on IRS.gov, on the \nIRS2Go mobile app or by calling the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954. To use the \nWhere's My Refund? tool, taxpayers need the primary Social Security number on the tax return, \nthe filing status and the expected refund amount. The refund status information updates once \ndaily. \nTaxpayers who still need to file for the 2024 tax year are encouraged to take advantage of \nelectronic filing options such as IRS Free File, which is available on IRS.gov through Oct. 20, or \nIRS Direct File, available to qualified taxpayers in 25 states. \nChoose a trusted tax professional \nTaxpayers who have yet to file a return might consider seeking assistance from a tax preparer. \nThe IRS provides resources if they need someone to prepare a tax return. The Directory of \nFederal Tax Return Preparers with Credentials and Select Qualifications can help \ntaxpayers find tax return preparers with professional certifications recognized by the IRS or who \nhave completed the IRS requirements for the Annual Filing Season Program. \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights \nTaxpayers have fundamental rights under the law that protect them when interacting with the \nIRS. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights divides them into 10 categories. IRS Publication 1, Your \nRights as a Taxpayer, reiterates these rights along with the agency's obligation to protect them. \nDigital and Mobile Adaptive Forms (DMAF) offer a safe and fast \nway to electronically engage with the IRS \nThe Digital and Mobile Adaptive Forms (DMAF) project is dedicated to developing the next \ngeneration of IRS non-tax forms for both taxpayers and IRS staff. These digital, mobile-friendly \nOnline payment options \n3 \nBack to Top \nforms display in a web browser, offering a better user experience while enhancing IRS \nefficiency.

The BSA authorizes the U.S. Treasury Department to require financial institutions to \nkeep records of cash transactions, to report suspicious activity that may signify crimes such as \nmoney laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activity, and to gather information about their \ncustomers to prevent our financial system from being exploited for criminal purposes. \nDuring the previous three fiscal years, 87.3% of IRS-CI’s investigations recommended for \nprosecution had a primary subject with a related BSA filing, and adjudicated cases resulted in a \n97.3% conviction rate with defendants receiving average prison sentences of 37 months. IRS-\nCI also used BSA data to identify $21.1 billion in fraud tied to tax and financial crimes, seize \n$8.2 billion in assets tied to criminal activity, and obtain $1.4 billion in restitution for crime \nvictims. \n“Public-private partnerships thrive when everyone mutually benefits, and to enhance our \npartnership with the financial industry, we plan to launch CI-FIRST which will promote \ninformation-sharing, streamline processes and demonstrate how valuable BSA data is to \ncriminal investigations,” said IRS-CI Chief Guy Ficco. \n“CI-FIRST” (Feedback in Response to Strategic Threats) is a new IRS-CI initiative that will \nestablish ongoing engagement with financial institutions. The program will ensure that financial \ninstitutions receive quantifiable results from IRS-CI on how the agency uses suspicious activity \nreports to investigate federal crimes. As part of this program, IRS-CI will also streamline \nsubpoena requests and share pointers with financial institutions on what to include in SARs to \nmaximize impact. CI-FIRST will serve as an opportunity to address what’s working and what can \nbe improved, creating continuous lines of communication between partners. IRS-CI \nheadquarters will work with larger financial institutions that have a national and international \npresence, and field office personnel will work with regional and community banks and credit \nunions in their respective areas of responsibility. \nIRS-CI special agents ran an average of 966,900 searches annually against currency \ntransaction reports during the last three fiscal years. Nearly 1,600 cases were opened in FY24 \nwith at least one currency transaction report on the primary subject. The data also indicates that \n67.4% of cases opened by IRS-CI had a subject with one of more currency transaction reports \nbelow $40,000, with 50% of currency transaction reports involving amounts less than $22,230. \nBSA data has also proven effective in helping IRS-CI combat narcotics trafficking and \npandemic-era tax fraud. Since FY20, IRS-CI used BSA data to initiate nearly 1,300 \ninvestigations with ties to fentanyl and investigate alleged employee retention credit fraud \ntotaling $5.5 billion. \nIRS-CI is the law enforcement arm of the IRS, responsible for conducting financial crime \ninvestigations, including tax fraud, narcotics trafficking, money-laundering, public corruption, \nhealthcare fraud, identity theft and more. IRS-CI is the only federal law enforcement agency with \ninvestigative jurisdiction over violations of the Internal Revenue Code, obtaining a 90% federal \nconviction rate. The agency has 20 field offices located across the U.S. and 14 attaché posts \nabroad.
