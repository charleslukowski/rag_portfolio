Every day, thousands \nof individuals and families receive free quality tax return preparation due to the efforts of our \ncommunity partners and volunteers. I deeply appreciate everything you do to design and \nimplement innovations that keep our Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling \nfor the Elderly (TCE) cause moving forward. \nDuring the 2024 filing season, dedicated SPEC partners supported more than 9,000 VITA and \nTCE sites, with more than 72,000 volunteers. VITA/TCE sites across the country prepared and \nfiled over 2.7 million federal tax returns. \nNothing is more satisfying than working with our communities and helping them grow. We focus \nso much on numbers, but it is the personal service we provide and relationships that we develop \nthat make what we do so special. Your commitment to this very important cause is unwavering \nand has not gone unnoticed. \nThank you again for all your time and effort this filing season. \nWith sincere appreciation, \nGwen Garren\nGwen Garren\nDirector, Stakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication\n6 SPEC MISSION\nSPEC MISSION\nStakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication (SPEC) mission is to assist taxpayers in satisfying \ntheir tax responsibilities by building and maintaining partnerships with key stakeholders, seeking to create and \nshare value by informing, educating, and communicating with our shared customers.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sponsors the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling \nfor the Elderly (TCE) programs. Since the implementation of the VITA program in 1969, thousands of \nvolunteers have provided free tax assistance and prepared millions of federal and state returns. The targeted \npopulation for VITA services includes individuals with low to moderate income (defined by the Earned Income \nTax Credit [EITC] threshold), persons with disabilities, elderly, and those with limited English proficiency (LEP). \nThe VITA program is vital to delivering service to those taxpayers who most need tax assistance and cannot \nafford the services of a paid preparer.\nThe TCE program offers free tax assistance to individuals who are age 60 or older. Â§163 of the Revenue Act of \n1978, Public Law No. 95-600, 92 Stat. 2810, November 6, 1978, authorizes this cooperative agreement. This \nAct authorizes the IRS to enter into agreements with private or nongovernmental public non-profit agencies \nand organizations, exempt under Â§501 of the IRC, which will provide training and technical assistance to \nvolunteers who provide free tax counseling and assistance to elderly individuals in the preparation of their \nfederal income tax returns.\nThe Virtual VITA/TCE approach uses the same process as traditional VITA/TCE except that the IRS-certified \npreparer and/or quality reviewer and the taxpayer may not always be face-to-face. Technology is used to \nconnect the volunteer preparer and the taxpayer. Although suitable for rural environments where it is difficult \nto build a traditional VITA site, this approach can also be used in urban settings to provide a free alternative to \nqualified taxpayers.\nTo help more taxpayers while increasing taxpayer education and promoting self-sufficiency, SPEC now also \ncaptures returns prepared through a Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) Model. FSA uses a certified volunteer \nto assist taxpayers in the preparation of their own tax return. Since the volunteer acts as a facilitator, each \nvolunteer can assist multiple taxpayers at one time. This approach allows sites to offer alternative filing \nmethods by helping taxpayers prepare their own simple returns. Partners can use any software that captures \nthe site identification number (SIDN).\nThe goal of the VITA/TCE program is to make voluntary adherence easier by:\nâ¢\t\nPromoting tax understanding and awareness\nâ¢\t\nPreparing free and accurate tax returns for eligible taxpayers\nâ¢\t\nEncouraging Financial Education and Asset Building (FEAB) through tax incentives\nâ¢\t\nIncorporating taxpayer feedback or viewpoints\nâ¢\t\nImproving issue resolution processes in all interactions with taxpayers\nâ¢\t\nProviding taxpayers with timely guidance and outreach\nâ¢\t\nStrengthening partnerships with tax practitioners, tax preparers, and other third parties to ensure \neffective tax administration\nPURPOSE OF THIS HANDBOOK 7\nPURPOSE OF THIS HANDBOOK\nThe purpose of Publication 5683, VITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators, is to inform you of \nyour obligations and expectations as a partner or coordinator and help you effectively administer and operate \nyour VITA/TCE tax preparation site. It covers the operation of the VITA/TCE program before, during, and \nafter the tax filing season. In addition, it explains the roles and responsibilities of the partner, coordinator, and \nvolunteer.\nBoth partners and coordinators should review the table of contents to become familiar with the topics covered \nand refer to it as needed throughout the year to assist with your siteâs operations. Answers to many of the \nquestions most asked by partners and coordinators while operating their sites can be found in this handbook.\nBelow are the icons that will appear throughout this handbook for ease of navigation. Hyperlinks in blue bold \ntype will link you directly to the document, webpage, or email address. Also, the Table of Content is linked to \njump to each topic listing.\nPlease email any suggestions for updates to this handbook or VITA/TCE program changes to partner@irs.\ngov and/or your local SPEC territory office.\n.\n8 CHAPTER 1: VITA/TCE Program Guidelines",

    "text": "CHAPTER 1: VITA/TCE Program Guidelines\nStakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication (SPEC) is a three-pronged business model:\nTax Education - IRS outreach program provides critical information to taxpayers ensuring they understand \nand comply with their tax obligations. Partners and community-based coalitions share information designed to \nenhance the publicâs knowledge of general income tax law, available tax credits, current legislative changes \naffecting tax law and availability/advantages to e-file. \nTax Preparation Services - The SPEC volunteer tax return preparation program, Volunteer Income Tax \nAssistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE), provide free tax preparation services for low to \nmoderate income taxpayers such as the elderly, persons with disabilities, Native Americans, rural taxpayers, \nand those individuals with limited English proficiency.\nFinancial Education and Asset Building - The goal is to work with partners who provide free tax preparation \nsites to encourage taxpayers to use their refund dollars to improve their financial health. By working in \nconnection with financial institutions and other organizations, partners can provide the financial options \ntaxpayers need and want, such as banking, savings, debit cards, financial counseling, and other financial \nservices. Incentives like these present an affordable way for taxpayers to begin asset building and achieve \nfinancial independence.\nSPEC is the outreach and education function of the IRS. The SPEC mission shares the strategies of many \ncommunity organizations striving to assist taxpayers in satisfying their responsibilities. We do this by building \nand maintaining partnerships with key stakeholders, seeking to create and share value by informing, \neducating, and communicating with shared customers.\nSPEC develops and supports leveraged partnerships and coalitions to deliver most of its programs and \nservices. SPEC oversees the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly \n(TCE) programs, which offer free tax return preparation to low to moderate-income taxpayers, senior citizens, \npersons with disabilities, those with limited English proficiency, and Native Americans. SPEC supports VITA/\nTCE tax preparation sites by conducting oversight reviews to ensure sites adhere to the established Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct (VSC) and Quality Site Requirements (QSR).",

Taxpayers expect an accurate tax return and protection of their information to ensure the privacy and \nconfidentiality of the data they share. Partners and volunteers must keep the information confidential and \nprotect it from unauthorized individuals and misuse. By signing this annual agreement, the sponsor agrees to \nmake certain their volunteers are aware of the standards of conduct, civil rights, privacy, and the key principles \nof confidentiality.\nForm 13533-A, FSA Remote Sponsor Agreement\nSponsors must complete Form 13533-A, FSA Remote Sponsor Agreement annually.

The VPA is not written exclusively for the Internal Revenue Service. This is a public law and \nrelates to organizations that use volunteers to provide services. Under the VPA, a âvolunteerâ is an individual \nperforming services for a non-profit organization or a governmental entity who does not receive:\nâ¢\t\nCompensation (other than reasonable reimbursement or allowance for expenses incurred), or\nâ¢\t\nAny other thing of value in lieu of compensation more than $500 per year\nThe term âvolunteerâ includes those serving as a director, officer, trustee, or direct service volunteer. Those \nwho do not fit this definition should seek advice from their sponsoring organizationâs attorneys to determine \nliability protection rights.\nThe purpose of the VPA is to promote the interests of social service program beneficiaries and taxpayers and \nto sustain the availability of programs, non-profit organizations, and governmental entities that depend on \nvolunteer contributions. It does this by providing certain protections from liability abuses related to volunteers \nserving non-profit organizations and governmental entities.\nThe VPA protects volunteers from liability if they were acting within the scope of the program and harm was \nnot caused by willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, and conscious, flagrant, \nindifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer. The VPA does not protect \nconduct that is willful or criminal, grossly negligent, reckless, or conduct that constitutes a conscious, flagrant \nindifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer.\nAll IRS-certified volunteer preparers must only prepare returns that are within scope of the VITA/TCE \nprograms. All out-of-scope returns must be referred to a professional return preparer. For additional information \non VITA/TCE in-scope topics, refer to the Scope of Service Chart in Publication 4012, VITA/TCE Volunteer \nResource Guide. The definition of âscopeâ refers to VITA/TCE eligible tax law topics applied to a volunteer \nprepared tax return. Scope does not refer to income levels.\nAs a coordinator, you are responsible for protecting and monitoring your volunteers to ensure they are adhering \nto the Quality Site Requirements and preparing returns within the scope of the VITA/TCE programs. In general, \nif volunteers only prepare returns within the scope of the VITA/TCE programs and adhere to the Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct, they are protected. However, local state laws still must be considered. Sponsoring \norganizations should seek advice from their attorneys to determine how this law protects their volunteers.",

Also host an âend of filing season picnicâ \nto present awards and certificates.â\nâ¢\t âAdd volunteers who are friends or relatives and want to help taxpayers.â\nFoster Effective Leadership\nPartners found effective site leadership contributed to the satisfaction of their volunteers.\nâ¢\t âSite coordinators make or break a site. When you change site coordinators you change the entire culture of \nthe site.â\nâ¢\t âThe positive and negative satisfaction comes from the site coordinator.â\nâ¢\t âAn energetic and motivated leader communicates well and frequently with the volunteers, soliciting their \ninput for improvement and making it happen immediately. Make them feel empowered and valued.â\nâ¢\t âTreat volunteers with respect, never forget they are volunteers and could be doing anything else with their \ntime and instead chose VITA.â\nâ¢\t âPartners should visit each site throughout the filing season to bring them treats and just say âthank youâ to \nthe volunteers.â\nMake Community Connections\nSeveral VITA/TCE sites share how they cultivate connections in their communities to build cadres of \nvolunteers. These community connections may include employers, colleges, and universities.\nâ¢\t âMany of the volunteers are retirees from large companies who are very dedicated to returning year after \nyear.â\nâ¢\t  âForm partnerships with employers whose employees operate a site. Some employers allow their \nvolunteers to do tax preparation on site during their normal business hours.â\nâ¢\t âEncourage volunteers to return each year. Recruit students from the nearby high schools and universities.â\nâ¢\t âDistribute public service announcements in the community about the benefits of VITA/TCE volunteering. \nPromote the various forms of available credits (college, CPE, and volunteer graduation/scholarship) and \nopportunities (internships, tax preparation education).â\nCommunicate with Volunteers Year-Round \nSuccessful partners communicate with volunteers before, during and after the filing season. Effective \ncommunication can be as unique as the partners themselves, such as newsletters, social activities, emails, \nmeetings, mini-training sessions, and volunteer web-portals. \nMost partners emphasized the importance of off-season communication to keep volunteers engaged with the \nVITA/TCE program. Keeping in touch with volunteers throughout the year promotes camaraderie and provides \na way to share technical knowledge, keeping volunteersâ skills sharp.\n28 CHAPTER 4: Volunteer Recruitment, Training and Certification",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4-5: Volunteer Training and Certification\nDeveloping a Training Program\nA basic component of quality service is ensuring the accuracy of income tax returns prepared at VITA/TCE \nsites. A tax return is accurate when the volunteers apply the tax law correctly, and the completed return \nis free from errors. The accuracy is based on the taxpayer interview, all supporting documentation, and a \ncompleted Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet. Numerous elements contribute to return \npreparation accuracy. Key among these elements is annual volunteer training and certification. All volunteers \nare required to register and certify via Link & Learn Taxes (LLT).\nPartners need to develop training programs based on the number of volunteers, the volunteersâ experience \nlevel, and the needs of the taxpayers they will serve. You can conduct training as self-study, classroom training, \nor a combination of both. At a minimum, your training plan must include training in Volunteer Standards of \nConduct (VSC), Intake/Interview and Quality Review, tax law, use of return preparation software (TaxSlayer), \nand Quality Site Requirements (policy and procedures).\nAs you prepare your training schedule, place emphasis on providing your volunteers Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review Training. Your coordinators are your strongest ally in this effort. Consider engaging the \ncoordinators in discussions on how they can improve the volunteerâs interview skills. For example, role-plays \ncan demonstrate the correct interview methods.\nAll training may not apply to every volunteer. For example, coordinators must complete specialized coordinator \ntraining. You may also find the need to provide additional training for peer-to-peer or designated quality \nreviewers and for volunteers acting as your Electronic Return Originators (ERO).\nWhile the focus of the VITA/TCE program is on the preparation of federal income tax returns, partners may \nneed to develop training programs with curriculum covering state income tax return preparation. Contact your \nState Department of Revenue for ideas, advice, and available resources.\nVITA/TCE Training Policies and Procedures \nPartners need to ensure that all volunteers receive training on the policies and procedures that are essential \nto the VITA/TCE program. At a minimum, this training must include a review of the Quality Site Requirements \n(QSR). Other topics to include:\nâ¢\t\nTaxpayer rights and responsibilities\nâ¢\t\nServing taxpayers with disabilities (See Chapter 9)\nâ¢\t\nConfidentiality of taxpayer data\nâ¢\t\nScope of service\nâ¢\t\nSite administrative issues \nâ¢\t\nSite specific forms and procedures  \nâ¢\t\nFinancial services offered at tax preparation time\nThe partnerâs needs primarily dictate the content and format of this training.\nPublication 5166, VITA/TCE Volunteer Quality Site Requirements, is an electronic publication that covers the \nten QSR.

All VITA/TCE volunteers must pass VSC certification, and sign and date Form 13615, Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct Agreement â VITA/TCE Programs. By signing this form, the volunteer is agreeing to \ncomply with the requirements and uphold the highest ethical standards. An approving official must review, and \nsign and date the form. Volunteers who perform only administrative duties, like greeters or facilitators, must \ncertify, at a minimum, in Volunteer Standards of Conduct.\nAll new and returning volunteer instructors, preparers, coordinators, and quality reviewers must take \nPublication 5101, VITA/TCE Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training and pass Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review certification. Volunteer greeters, screeners and client facilitators who assist taxpayers with \ncompleting Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, must also take Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review Training and certify. \nVolunteer instructors must certify in Volunteer Standards of Conduct, Intake/Interview and Quality Review, \nand tax law.

The preparerâs certification level must be at, or above, the level needed for the tax returns \nprepared.\nDesignated or peer-to-peer quality reviewers must certify in Volunteer Standards of Conduct, Intake/ \nInterview and Quality Review, and tax law. Quality reviewers must (at a minimum) certify at the Basic level or \nhigher (including specialty levels) based on the complexity of the tax returns reviewed.\nCoordinators must certify in Volunteer Standards of Conduct, Intake/Interview and Quality Review, and \nthe Site Coordinator Test, prior to performing any coordinator duties. Coordinators must complete the site \ncoordinator training. Site coordinator training includes reviewing Publication 5088, VITA/TCE Site Coordinator \nTraining. Coordinators who prepare tax returns, provide tax law assistance, correct rejected returns, or quality \nreview tax returns, must certify in tax law to the level required for the complexity of the returns. If they do not \nperform any of these duties, there is no requirement for certification in tax law.\nFederal Tax Law Update Test for Circular 230 Professionals (C230): SPEC offers a tax law certification test \nthat allows VITA/TCE volunteers who have the professional designation of attorney, Certified Public Accountant \n(CPA), or Enrolled Agent (EA) to certify on new provisions and tax law changes. Volunteers with professional \ndesignations must have an active license and be in good standing. In addition, the volunteers must certify in \nVolunteer Standards of Conduct and Intake/Interview and Quality Review. The C230 is optional. Volunteers \nwho want additional training can choose the traditional certification paths available to all new and returning \nvolunteers. Once successfully completing the required certifications for the C230, eligible volunteers are \nauthorized to prepare all tax returns within the scope of the VITA/TCE program. Volunteers certifying only in \nthis tax law certification are not eligible for Continuing Education credits. In addition, if the volunteer covered by \nC230 is going to perform the duties of a coordinator, they must take the Site Coordinator Training and pass the \nSite Coordinator Test with a score of 80% or higher.\nSPEC established the minimum certification requirements for volunteers authorized under C230; however, \npartners may establish additional certification requirements for their volunteers. Partners may require all \nvolunteers to use the traditional certification path. Volunteers should check with the sponsoring partner. \nReminder: The C230 certification does not qualify volunteers for CE credits. Volunteers seeking CE credits \nmust certify to Advanced level to qualify. For more information, see Chapter 5: Continuing Education Credits.\n32 CHAPTER 4: Volunteer Recruitment, Training and Certification \nVolunteer Standards of Conduct - Ethics Training\nVolunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) training is specifically for VITA/TCE free tax preparation programs. \nOften volunteers face ethical issues, which arise in unexpected situations requiring quick decisions and good \njudgment. In many cases, a volunteer will react to an unusual situation and not realize it, until after the ethical \nissue has occurred.\nAll volunteers must prepare accurate returns and provide quality service to taxpayers. See Chapter 7 for an \nexplanation of each standard and the suggested corrective actions to take if a VSC violation occurs at a VITA/\nTCE site.\nVSC Training Resources:\nPublication 4961, VITA/TCE Volunteer Standards of Conduct â Ethics Training, is an electronic product used \nin classroom setting or for independent study.

Once the volunteer \npasses the Volunteer Standards of Conduct Test, and other certifications, if applicable, they should check \nthe Volunteer Agreement checkbox in LLT, acknowledging they read the Volunteer Standards of Conduct \nAgreement, and agree to adhere to the Volunteer Standards of Conduct. Volunteers certify by signing Form \n13615 electronically after all required tests are completed with a passing score of 80% or higher. The Form \n13615 created in LLT will record all the volunteerâs completed certifications.\nIntake/Interview and Quality Review Training and Certification\nSPEC emphasizes the positive correlation between the proper use of the Intake/Interview and Quality Review \nprocess and the preparation of an accurate tax return. SPEC oversight reviews indicate the accuracy of VITA/\nTCE returns has increased since the start of this process. Volunteers who refuse to use the complete intake \nand interview process and/or refuse to use the required quality review process are in violation of the Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct (VSC). All volunteers are encouraged to complete this training to ensure that they \nconsistent intake, interview and quality review processes.\nAll new and returning volunteer instructors, preparers, coordinators, and quality reviewers must take \nPublication 5101, VITA/TCE Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training and pass Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review certification test. Volunteer greeters, screeners and client facilitators who assign tax returns or \nassist taxpayers with completing Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, must also take \nIntake/Interview and Quality Review Training and certify.

    "text": "CHAPTER 6: Quality Site Requirements \nTaxpayers using VITA/TCE free tax services should be confident they are receiving accurate tax return \npreparation and quality service. The purpose of the Quality Site Requirements (QSR) is to ensure the quality \nand accuracy of tax return preparation and consistent site operation. Partners must communicate the QSR to \nall volunteers. All partners and volunteers must follow all QSR to ensure accurate tax return preparation and \nhigh-quality site operation.\nViolation of Volunteer Standards of Conduct #1, Follow all Quality Site Requirements\nIf any volunteer refuses to adhere, comply, or follow a QSR they have violated Volunteer Standards of Conduct \n(VSC) #1, Follow all Quality Site Requirements. Partners and coordinators who find a VSC violation must \nemail SPEC headquarters at wi.voltax@irs.gov and copy the partner and the local SPEC territory office as \nappropriate. The email notification should include the reporting personâs name, contact number, site name, \nand a detailed description of the incident including the full name of the person who violated the VSC, date the \nincident occurred, and the number of taxpayerâs affected by the violation if applicable.\nQuality Site Requirements for Alternative Filing Models\nAlthough originally written for the traditional VITA/TCE site model, partners must also apply the QSR to all \nalternative filing models, including Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA). Whether preparing returns in-person or \nusing alternative filing models, volunteers must follow the Quality Site Requirements (QSR) and adhere to the \nVolunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC). SPEC provides guidance applying the QSR to alternative filing models \nin Publication 5324, Fact Sheet: Quality Site Requirements for Alternative Filing Models for SPEC Partners and \nEmployees.\nQSR #1: Certification\nVolunteers must complete their certifications using the IRS electronic tests through Link & Learn Taxes \n(LLT). Volunteers who prefer to take the Certification Test on paper utilizing Form 6744, VITA/TCE Volunteer \nAssistorâs Test or Retest, may continue to complete the test using that method but must transcribe their \nanswers to the Test in LLT. Volunteersâ names and addresses in LLT must match their government-issued \nphoto identification. SPEC recommends that volunteers update their âMy Accountâ page in LLT with their valid \nname and address.\nâ¢\t\nVolunteer training may consist of classroom training, self-study, and/or LLT.\nâ¢\t\nVolunteers have two attempts to pass each certification with a passing score of 80% or above on each \ncertification.\nNew volunteers must take the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) Training. The training is available in \nLLT and in Publication 4961, VITA/TCE Volunteer Standards of Conduct - Ethics Training. SPEC encourages \nreturning volunteers to review the VSC training as a refresher. All volunteers must pass the VSC certification \nusing LLT prior to working at a site.\nâ¢\t\nAll new and returning volunteer instructors, preparers, coordinators, and quality reviewers must review \nPublication 5101, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training and pass Intake/Interview and Quality \nReview certification. Volunteer greeters, screeners and client facilitators who assist taxpayers with \ncompleting Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, must also take Intake/ Interview \nand Quality Review Training and certify.\nâ¢\t\nThis training will be offered virtually with a Q&A session via Webcaster. Link is available in Publication \n5325, Fact Sheet: Filing Season Training for SPEC Partners and Volunteers.\nâ¢\t\nAll volunteer greeters, screeners and client facilitators who assign tax returns for return preparation \nmust also take Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training and certify.\nVolunteers who answer tax law questions, instruct tax law classes, prepare, or correct tax returns, and/ or \nconduct quality reviews of completed tax returns, must certify in tax law prior to conducting tax law related \ntasks. Screeners and client facilitators who answer tax law questions must also certify in tax law.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 6: Quality Site Requirements  41\nTax law certification is an annual requirement. Volunteers who do not help with tax law related issues \n(for example, greeters, receptionists, equipment coordinators) do not have to certify in tax law but must \nstill complete the VSC certification test via LLT. See Publication 5166, VITA/TCE Volunteer Quality Site \nRequirements for a chart on required training for volunteer positions.\nIRS tax law certified volunteer preparers must prepare tax returns that are within scope of the VITA/ \nTCE program. Volunteers must spot out-of-scope returns early in the tax return preparation process.\nRefer all out-of-scope tax returns to a professional tax return preparer. Scope refers to VITA/TCE tax law topics \napplied to a volunteer prepared tax return. Scope does not refer to income levels. A Scope of Service Chart is \nin Publication 4012, VITA/TCE Volunteer Resource Guide.\nâ¢\t\nTax law instructors must certify in tax law at the Advanced level or higher.\nâ¢\t\nIRS tax law certified volunteer preparers can only prepare returns with tax issues that fall within their \ncertification level. If the site is preparing tax returns above the Basic certification level, the volunteer \npreparer must certify to the level needed to prepare these returns.\nâ¢\t\nDesignated and peer-to-peer quality reviewers can only quality review returns with tax issues that fall \nwithin their certification levels. If the site is preparing tax returns above the Basic certification level, the \nquality reviewers must certify to the level needed to quality review these returns.\nâ¢\t\nVolunteers may take other specialty certifications.\n\t\nâ\nVolunteers must first certify in Volunteer Standards of Conduct before taking OPI certification.\n\t\nâ\nVolunteers must first certify at either Basic or Advanced level before taking the specialty \ncertification for Puerto Rico.\n\t\nâ\nVolunteers must first certify at the Advanced level before taking the Military and International \nspecialty certifications.\nâ¢\t\nFederal Tax Law Update Test for Circular 230 Professionals (C230) - SPEC offers a tax law certification \ntest that allows VITA/TCE volunteers who have the professional designation of attorney, Certified Public \nAccountant (CPA), or Enrolled Agent (EA) to certify on new provisions and tax law changes. Volunteers \nwith professional designations must have an active license and be in good standing. In addition, the \nvolunteers must certify in Volunteer Standards of Conduct and Intake/Interview and Quality Review. \nThe C230 test is an optional certification. Volunteers who want more training can choose the traditional \ncertification paths available to all volunteers.\nâ¢\t\nVolunteers who successfully pass the C230 test can prepare all tax returns within the scope of the \nVITA/TCE program. SPEC created the minimum certification requirements for volunteers who are \nauthorized under Circular 230; however, partners may establish additional certification requirements for \ntheir volunteers. Volunteers and coordinators should check with the sponsoring SPEC partner.\nVolunteers who certify only in C230 for tax law are not eligible for Continuing Education (CE) credits.\nSPEC requirements may be different from partner requirements. Partners may require a higher level of \ntraining. However, partner requirements can never be lower than IRS requirements. For example, some \npartners require their coordinators to be certified at the Advanced tax law certification level, even if they do \nnot give tax law advice, prepare, or correct tax returns. For example, AARP Foundation Tax-Aide (Tax-Aide) \nrequires tax counselors to certify at the Advanced level. This is an acceptable practice.\nCoordinators and alternate coordinators must complete site coordinator training annually. There are several \noptions for completing site coordinator training:\nâ¢\t\nAttend local territory training sessions scheduled between October and December\nâ¢\t\nAttend partner-provided training on the topics covered in Publication 5088, VITA/TCE Site Coordinator \nTraining or\nâ¢\t\nIndividually review Publication 5088, which is available on Link & Learn Taxes (LLT) or IRS.gov.\n42 CHAPTER 6: Quality Site Requirements \nQSR #2: Intake/Interview and Quality Review Process\nAll taxpayers using the services offered through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax \nCounseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs should be confident they are receiving accurate return preparation \nand quality service. Three vital processes that result in accurate returns and quality service are: effective \nintake, thorough taxpayer interview and complete quality review of the tax return.\nRequired Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training\nAll coordinators, return preparers, quality reviewers, and instructors must take Intake/Interview and Quality \nReview Training. Greeters, screeners, and client facilitators who assign tax returns or answer tax law questions \nmust also take Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training. Refer to Publication 5101, VITA/TCE Intake/\nInterview and Quality Review Training, available in LLT and IRS.gov.\nAlso, all instructors, coordinators, return preparers and quality reviewers must pass the Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review certification test located on LLT. Greeters, screeners, and client facilitators who assign tax \nreturns or answer tax law questions must also pass the Intake/Interview and Quality Review certification \ntest. Volunteers can use Form 6744, VITA/TCE Volunteer Assistorâs Test/Retest, as a tool to prepare for the \ncertification test.\nIntake and Interview Processes\nIRS developed Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, for use in the intake and interview, \nand quality review processes at VITA/TCE sites. SPEC updates Form 13614-C for the tax year and if \napplicable, incorporates tax law changes and process improvements. All sites must use the approved current \nyear revision of Form 13614-C for every tax return prepared by an IRS tax law certified volunteer. \nForm 13614-C guides the IRS tax law certified volunteer preparer through the interview with the taxpayer and \nallows them to gather all information to prepare an accurate return. The volunteer quality reviewer uses the \ncompleted tax return, completed Form 13614-C, the taxpayerâs supporting documentation, and preparerâs \nnotes and comments to verify the tax return is free from error.\nNew! The FY2025 Form 13614-C revision is redesigned to be more user-friendly and provide additional space \nfor taxpayer and preparer comments.\nPartners may ask other questions that are not on Form 13614-C but cannot create their own version of \nthis form. AARP Foundation Tax-Aide (Tax-Aide) uses an approved âIntake Bookletâ which includes \nForm 13614-C.\nAll IRS tax law certified volunteer preparers must complete the intake and interview processes before \npreparing tax returns. To promote accuracy, this process must include an interview with the taxpayer while \nreviewing Form 13614-C and all supporting documents prior to preparing the tax return. Publication 5838, \nVITA/TCE Intake/Interview and Quality Review Handbook is a key resource for volunteers on how to conduct \neffective intake, interview, and quality review of tax returns at VITA/TCE sites.\nWhile completing the intake and interview process, verify that the tax return is within the scope of the VITA/ \nTCE program and the volunteerâs certification level.\nâ¢\t\nIf the return is not within the scope for VITA/TCE, explain to the taxpayer they must seek assistance \nfrom a professional preparer. \nIf the tax return does not fall within the volunteerâs certification level, refer the taxpayer to another IRS \ntax law certified volunteer preparer with the proper certification level or to another site that prepares returns at \nthat certification level.",

Explain that incorrect information may delay \nthe processing of their tax return. \nâ¢\t\nEnsure taxpayer has everything needed to prepare the return: photo ID, Social Security card, individual \ntaxpayer identification number (ITIN), all tax documents.\nâ¢\t\nProvide Form 13614-C to the taxpayer.

Refer to QSR #3 for more information.\nâ¢\t\nVerify each answer on pages 1 through 3.  On pages 2 and 3, confirm each checked box is accurate. \nIf a taxpayer incorrectly checked a box, erase, or cross out the box and put your initials. Unchecked \nquestions must be discussed with the taxpayer to verify they do not apply to the taxpayerâs situation. \nMark âNoâ, or âN/Aâ to indicate the question was verified.\nâ¢\t\nUse the gray shaded section on the right side of pages 2 and 3 to leave notes or clarify answers. \nâ¢\t\nExercise due diligence by using probing questions to gather complete information.\nâ¢\t\nMake filing status and dependency determinations by using the resource tools.  \nâ¢\t\nVerify the âTo be completed by certified volunteerâ gray shaded area is completed.\nâ¢\t\nReview all supporting documentation provided by the taxpayer (Forms W-2, 1099, 1095, payment \nreceipts, etc.).\nDuring the intake and interview process, only IRS tax law certified volunteer preparers can review, correct, and/ \nor clarify tax related information. Preparer must notate comments when taxpayerâs answers change, or they \nprovide additional information.  \nAdditional Intake and Interview Requirements for Sites using Virtual VITA/TCE Models\nIn addition to using Form 13614-C, sites using any process under the Virtual VITA/TCE model must document \nthose processes on Form 14446, Virtual VITA/TCE Taxpayer Consent. \nBefore the intake process, the volunteer must explain the virtual method(s) and step- by- step procedures \nto the taxpayer. Taxpayers must agree to participate in the virtual method by checking the request to review \nand the consent disclosure boxes and signing Form 14446 as shown below. For detailed information on Form \n14446, refer to Publication 5450, VITA/ TCE Site Operations.\n44 CHAPTER 6: Quality Site Requirements \n \nForm 14446 Virtual Consent\nDue Diligence\nBy law, tax return preparers must exercise due diligence in preparing or assisting in the preparation of tax \nreturns. IRS defines due diligence as the degree of care and caution reasonably expected from, and ordinarily \nexercised by, a volunteer in the VITA/TCE program. This means, as a volunteer, you must do your part when \npreparing or quality reviewing a tax return to ensure the information on the return is correct and complete. \nDoing your part includes confirming a taxpayerâs (and spouse, if married filing jointly) identity and providing top- \nquality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities.\nGenerally, IRS tax law certified volunteers may rely in good faith on information from a taxpayer without \nrequiring documentation as verification. However, part of due diligence requires volunteers to ask a taxpayer \nto clarify information that may appear to be inconsistent or incomplete. When reviewing information for its \naccuracy, volunteers need to ask themselves if the information is unusual or questionable.",

Any box that should be checked, \nmust be corrected after discussion with the taxpayer.\nâ¢\t\nReview supporting documentation.\nâ¢\t\nMake updates and notes as needed for quality reviewer to understand. Use the column on the right side \nof pages 2 and 3 to make notes. Additional space for preparer notes is on page 5. \nIf a taxpayer is unable to complete the form, an IRS tax law certified volunteer preparer will complete it \nwith the taxpayer by asking all questions and recording the answers.\nGray Area on Page 1: âTo be completed by certified preparerâ\nAn IRS tax law certified volunteer preparer completes this section. These questions help the volunteer make \ntax law determinations for dependency, filing status, and qualified tax credits. The volunteer must complete the \nquestions listed in the gray shaded area under âTo be completed by certified preparerâ, for each person listed by \nthe taxpayer(s).\nâ¢\t\nIf any of these persons are claimed on the tax return, then all questions must be answered.\nâ¢\t\nIf someone listed is not claimed on the return, then only the disqualifying question(s) must be answered.\nPotential Certification Levels for Tax Law Issues\nPages 2 and 3 of Form 13614-C show the potential required tax law certification level for each question. The \nlevels B (Basic), A (Advanced) and M (Military) are listed in front of the questions. A greeter, screener or client \nfacilitator assigning or selecting the tax return for preparation must understand how to select the certification \nlevel required for that return. If they cannot assign the taxpayer to an IRS tax law certified volunteer preparer with \nthe required certification level, they must seek help.\nAn IRS tax law certified volunteer preparer determines if the taxpayerâs return can be prepared at the site \nafter the interview is completed. The final decision will be based on a combination of the siteâs return \npreparation policy, the Scope of Service Chart listed in Publication 4012 and/or Tax-Aide approved tax \nlaw criteria.\n46 CHAPTER 6: Quality Site Requirements \nMaking Corrections\nVolunteer preparer: Correct errors or omissions of information found prior to or during the interview with the \ntaxpayer and enter on Form 13614-C before preparing the return. It is important to capture these notes so the \nquality reviewer will have all the information which was used to prepare the tax return.\nNew! The revised Form 13614-C includes a notes/comments column on pages 2 and 3 to leave notes for the \nquality reviewer. Additional space for notes is located on page 5.\nQuality reviewer: Follow the siteâs established procedures to correct errors found on Form 13614-C and on \nthe tax return. Write comments about any corrections on Form 13614-C. After corrections are made, review \nthe corrected return for accuracy. Once the return is accurate it is signed by the taxpayer(s) and processed \nfor timely filing.\nMaintaining Forms 13614-C\nAfter the return is complete partners/sites can return Form 13614-C to taxpayers with a copy of their return. \nSome partners/sites keep Form 13614-C until tax returns are accepted. Site must securely destroy any \nretained Forms 13614-C by December 31. For guidance on secure storage and proper disposal of taxpayer \ninformation, refer to Publication 4299.\nIf partners keep Form 13614-C for anything other than tax return preparation, they must secure taxpayer \napproval by obtaining a signed Consent to âUseâ and Consent to âDiscloseâ. Taxpayers must sign the \nconsents which must include specific information as described in the Internal Revenue Code Section 7216. \nFor more information and guidance on preparing these written consents and safeguarding taxpayer data, \nrefer to Publication 5471, Fact Sheet: Disclosure and Use of Tax Information - Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \n7216 Requirements for VITA/TCE Partners.\nQuality Review Process\nEvery site must use a complete quality review process for all returns prepared to ensure accuracy. A tax \nreturn is considered accurate when tax law is applied correctly, and the completed return is free from error \nbased on the completed Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet (or Form 13614-NR), the \ntaxpayerâs interview and the taxpayerâs supporting documentation.

The certification box on Form 13206 must \nbe checked. \nPartners or coordinators must give their volunteer list to their local SPEC territory office by February 3, but \nno later than February 15. As sites bring on new volunteers, partners or coordinators must report these new \nvolunteers to the local SPEC territory office by the third of each month.\nThe partner-created document must contain the same information for the volunteers required on Form 13206. \nIt must show that each volunteer has completed the VSC certification and signed Form 13615, Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct Agreement â VITA/TCE Programs, agreeing to adhere to the VSC. The document \nmust also show the partnerâs approving official verified the volunteerâs identity, name, and address, using \ngovernment-issued photo identification and signed and dated Form 13615. It is important to report a volunteer \nonly once to the local SPEC territory, even if they work at more than one site.\nCopies of Forms 13206, Volunteer Assistance Summary Report, or similar document containing the \nsame information, should be available at the partner or site location with the required information for \neach volunteer verifying agreement to the VSC and certification level. If these forms are not available at \nthe site, the coordinator must have a method in place to track volunteer certification levels and be able \nto provide this information upon request.\nTax-Aide will complete and send a combined list of volunteer certifications to SPEC headquarters containing \nthe same information as requested on Form 13206. Tax-Aide must secure Forms 13615 from all volunteers \nand the list should show each volunteer has signed and dated their agreement and their identities, names and \naddresses were validated using a government-issued ID.\nPartners do not have to keep Forms 13615 once the volunteer and partner have:\nâ¢\t\nSigned the completed agreement.\nâ¢\t\nAccurately transferred all required data to the current Form 13206 or partner created document \n(containing the same information).\nâ¢\t\nSent Form 13206, or partner created list, to the local SPEC territory office.\nâ¢\t\nSubmitted completed Form 13615 for CE Credits \nPartners can destroy Form 13615 or return it to the volunteer.\nFor volunteers requesting CE credits, Form 13615 must be signed in both the certification section and \nthe CE credit section. For more information see Publication 5362, Fact Sheet: Continuing Education \nCredits for VITA/TCE Partners and Volunteers.\n50 CHAPTER 6: Quality Site Requirements \nAfter agreeing to follow the Volunteer Standards of Conduct by signing Form 13615, volunteers must report \nunethical behavior at a VITA/TCE site by emailing SPEC headquarters at wi.voltax@ irs.gov and copy the \npartner and the local SPEC territory office as appropriate. The email notification should include your name, \ncontact number, site name, and a detailed description of the incident including the individuals full name, date \nthe incident occurred, and the number of taxpayerâs affected by the violation, if applicable.\nThe latest revision of Publication 4836 VITA/TCE Free Tax Programs also referred to as the âVolTaxâ \nposter, must be available to all taxpayers who seek services at the site. The purpose of the poster is to \nmake taxpayers aware of their opportunity to report unethical behavior. Publication 4836 is an electronic \nonly product and sites will need to print in English, Spanish or both and post for in-person service. Form \n13614- C, Intake/Interview & Quality Review Sheet, and Publication 730 (EN-SP), Important Tax \nRecords Envelope (VITA/TCE), also include the VolTax email address.\nQSR #6: Timely Filing of Tax Returns\nAll coordinators must have a process in place to ensure every tax return is timely electronically filed or \ndelivered to the taxpayer.\nSites must not stockpile taxpayer returns. Stockpiling is waiting more than three calendar days to submit the \nreturn once the site has all necessary tax documents. Tax returns must be e-filed no more than three calendar \ndays after the site has secured all necessary information from the taxpayer and completed all necessary tax \npreparation steps required to file the taxpayers return electronically. \nThis means the taxpayer has completed the intake/interview process, provided all necessary tax documents, \ncompleted the Quality Review, and has provided consent to the site to e-file the return through the signing of \nForm 8879.  Once these steps have been completed, the VITA/TCE site has three calendar days to e-file the \nreturn. \nReturns must be completed within a reasonable timeframe.  If due to lack of response, delays with \nresolving rejects, signing Form 8879 or volunteer staffing, sites must notify taxpayers that the return \nhas been deactivated in the tax preparation software and to return to the site to pick up their tax \ndocuments. If the taxpayer does not return to the site, per Publication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality, and \nCivil Rights, sites must properly dispose of tax documents including burning or shredding the data. \nFor e-filed tax returns, the taxpayer (and spouse, if married filing jointly) must sign Form 8879, IRS e-file \nSignature Authorization prior to the transmission of the return to IRS. Taxpayers must sign and date Form 8879 \nafter reviewing the return and ensuring the tax return information on the form matches the information on the \nreturn.\nWhile IRS requires Form 8879 be retained for three years by commercial preparers, VITA/TCE sites received a \nwaiver from this requirement for Form 8879 and supporting documents. Volunteers do not send Forms 8879 to \nthe IRS. Instead, volunteers give the signed Form 8879 to the taxpayer along with a copy of their tax return. A \nsigned Form 8879 gives the site permission to e-file the return and allows the taxpayers the opportunity to read \nthe important declaration prior to submission of the e-filed tax return. See Publication 4299 for information on \nexceptions in securing signatures on Form 8879.\nVolunteers must resolve all rejects as soon as possible. Volunteers must inform taxpayers within 24 hours if \nthey cannot correct the reject. Taxpayers must sign a new, corrected Form 8879 if the electronic return data on \ntheir individual income tax returns changes and the amounts differ by more than either $50 to âTotal incomeâ or \nâAGI,â or $14 to âTotal tax,â âFederal income tax withheld,â âRefundâ or âAmount you owe.â \nSites can assist taxpayers with filing Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension to File US Individual",

Please refer to IRS.gov for the availability of Publication \n4053 in various languages. \nThese posters provide volunteers and taxpayers with contact information to report discriminatory treatment. If \na taxpayer or volunteer has a civil rights complaint, refer them to the contact information on Publication 4053 \n(en-sp). If taxpayers request the information in writing, offer Publication 4454, Your Civil Rights are Protected. \nPublication 4454 is an optional brochure designed to notify taxpayers of their civil rights when the site cannot \nprovide tax preparation services (for example, lack of information to prepare the return, the return is not within \nscope of the VITA/ TCE program).\nTaxpayers must have access to the civil rights information even if they do not have a tax return \nprepared. At a traditional site, the poster must be visible at the first point of contact between the \ntaxpayer and volunteer. For virtual sites, the poster must be sent or made available to all seeking \nservices. \nIt is not acceptable to use Publication 730 (EN-SP) or the Tax-Aide envelope as the source for notifying the \ntaxpayers of their civil rights. This product offers information to the taxpayer who receives service, not the \ntaxpayer who is denied service.\n52 CHAPTER 6: Quality Site Requirements \nQSR #8: Correct Site Identification Number (SIDN)\nAll tax returns prepared by VITA/TCE sites must include the correct site identification number \n(SIDN). E-file administrators must set tax software defaults to make sure the correct SIDN \nautomatically appears on each tax return. Partners or coordinators should work with their local \nSPEC territory office to make sure they are using the correct SIDN.\nFor sites using TaxSlayer, the SIDNs are assigned in the Preparer(s) Setup Menu. TaxSlayer allows the \nSite Administrator to âPull from Officeâ, as this populates the SIDN that is sent from SPEC to TaxSlayer \nwith the software order. If the site is an ad hoc site, then follow the Pro Online Ad Hoc Site set up \ninstructions. For more guidance, refer to the VITA/TCE Blog.\nQSR #9: Correct Electronic Filing Identification Number (EFIN)\nAll tax returns prepared by VITA/TCE sites must include the correct electronic filing identification number \n(EFIN). All partners must use the online IRS e-file application process found in e-Services on IRS.gov to \napply for an EFIN or update an application. A separate EFIN is required for each physical location. E-file \nadministrators should set the tax software defaults to ensure the correct EFIN automatically appears on \nForm 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization.\nFor sites using TaxSlayer, the software populates with the EFIN included in the software order \nfrom SPEC. Sites should not be making changes to this EFIN without guidance from SPEC. If the \nsite is an ad hoc site, then a second Electronic Return Originator (ERO) account is set up, but the \nsite continues to use the EFIN of the main site.\nQSR #10: Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality\nPublication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Civil Rights - A Public Trust,  is the resource document \nfor guidance on securing and protecting personally identifiable information (PII) shared by taxpayers, \nvolunteers, and partners. A copy (paper or electronic) must be available at the site. Sites must follow \nall security, privacy, and confidentiality guidelines as outlined in Publication 4299.\nAll coordinators must have security procedures in place as described in Publication 4299 for the \nfollowing processes:\nâ¢\t\nPreparing an annual security plan to safeguard taxpayer data.

    "text": "Chapter 7: Volunteer Standards of Conduct\nThe integrity of the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) \nprograms depends on maintaining public trust. All taxpayers using VITA/TCE services should be confident they \nare receiving accurate tax return preparation and quality service.\nAll volunteers are responsible for providing the highest quality and best service to taxpayers. Along with this \nresponsibility, all volunteers must sign and date Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement each \nyear, stating they will uphold the highest ethical standards and follow all Quality Site Requirements (QSR).\nFurthermore, all IRS Stakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication (IRS-SPEC) partners must \nsign either Form 13533, Sponsor Agreement or Form 13533-A, FSA Remote Sponsor Agreement, certifying \nthey will adhere to the strictest standards of ethical conduct. By signing this agreement, the sponsor agrees \nto make certain their volunteers are aware of the standards of conduct and privacy and the key principles of \nconfidentiality.\nNew volunteers must complete the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) Training. Returning volunteers are \nencouraged to review the VSC Training as a refresher. All VITA/TCE volunteers must pass a VSC certification \ntest with a score of 80% or higher. The VSC Training will provide:\nâ¢\t\nAn explanation of the six Volunteer Standards of Conduct defined on Form 13615\nâ¢\t\nInformation on how to report possible violations.\nâ¢\t\nConsequences of failure to adhere to the program requirements.\nâ¢\t\nExamples of situation that raise question on ethical behavior.\nVolunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC)\nOften volunteers face ethical issues, which arise in unexpected situations requiring quick decisions and good \njudgment. In many cases, the volunteer will react to unusual situations and not realize until later that it was, in \nfact, an ethical dilemma.\nThe Volunteer Standards of Conduct were developed specifically for the operation of free tax preparation \nprograms. Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement â VITA/TCE Programs, applies to all \nconduct and ethical behavior affecting the VITA/TCE programs. Volunteers must agree to adhere to the \nstandards of conduct prior to working in a VITA/TCE free tax return preparation site.\nAll participants in the VITA/TCE programs must adhere to the following Volunteer Standards of Conduct:\nVSC #1 â Follow all Quality Site Requirements (QSR).\nThe purpose of the Quality Site Requirements (QSR) is to ensure the quality and accuracy of tax return \npreparation and consistent operation of sites.\nNon-adherence to any QSR becomes a violation of the VSC if volunteers refuse to follow the QSR. If the \nproblem is corrected, it is not a violation of the VSC.\nRefer to Publication 5166, VITA/TCE Volunteer Quality Site Requirements, for a full explanation of each QSR.\nVSC #2 â Do not accept payment, ask for donations, or accept refund payments for federal or \nstate tax return preparation from customers.\nâFreeâ means we do not accept payment for our services from the clients we serve. We do not want to confuse \nthe taxpayer by asking for donations. Donation or tip jars located in the return preparation or taxpayer waiting \narea are a violation of this standard.

Donation or tip jars \ncannot be in the entry, waiting, tax preparation, or quality review areas.\nA client may offer payment, but always refuse with a smile and say something like, âThank you, but we cannot \naccept payment for our services.â If someone insists, recommend cookies or donuts for the site. Taxpayers can \nmake cash donations to the sponsoring organization, but not in the tax preparation area. Refer taxpayers who \nare interested in making cash donations to the appropriate website or to the coordinator for more information.\nHaving fee-based preparation at the VITA site location while the VITA site is open is like tip jars within \nthe preparation space. This causes confusion to the taxpayer as VITA is advertised as a free service.\nYou finish a time-consuming return, and the client is very grateful. On her way out, the client stops by \nand tries to sneak a $20 bill in your pocket, saying, âI would have paid ten times that at the preparer \nacross the street.â Return the money and explain that you cannot accept money for doing taxes.\nTaxpayersâ federal or state refunds must not be deposited into VITA/TCE volunteersâ, partnersâ, or any \nassociated organizationsâ personal or business bank/debit card accounts. VITA/TCE sites must only request \ndirect deposit of a taxpayerâs refund into accounts bearing the taxpayerâs name.\nVSC #3 â Do not solicit business from taxpayers you help or use the information gained about \nthem (taxpayer information) for any direct or indirect personal benefit for yourself, any other \nspecific individual or organization.\nVolunteers must properly use and safeguard taxpayersâ personal information. Volunteers may not use \nconfidential or nonpublic information to engage in financial transactions. They cannot allow improper use of \ntaxpayer information to further their own, another personsâ or organizationsâ private interests.\nSPEC encourages partnering with banks or credit unions to promote unbanked taxpayers to open bank \naccounts. However, sites and volunteers cannot offer clients refund anticipation loans (RAL) or refund \nanticipation checks (RAC) when preparing federal or state tax returns. \nBelow is guidance for banks or credits unions who partner with VITA/TCE:\nâ¢\t\nVITA/TCE coalitions and partners must take steps, so taxpayers clearly understand tax services remain \nfree of cost regardless of whether they sign up for a bank or credit union membership or a refund \nanticipation loan.\nâ¢\t\n Bank or credit union information/enrollment tables must remain in a separate space from tax return \npreparation.\nâ¢\t\nBank or credit union offerings must be announced using general terms to potential customers separate \nfrom tax return preparation.\nâ¢\t\nVolunteers must not promote bank or credit union services by using information provided by the \ntaxpayer to prepare a tax return (such as the taxpayer not having a bank account or the amount of the \ntax refund). \nâ¢\t\nSPEC encourages VITA/TCE coalitions and partners to reach out and find additional financial \ninstitutions to offer services at VITA/TCE sites.  To avoid the appearance of endorsement or preferential \ntreatment, SPEC recommends giving other financial institutions with similar products with the same or \nsimilar terms to be present at the location separate from tax return preparation. \nSPEC determined having a representative of a bank or credit union present at the same location as a \nVITA/TCE site but separate from the tax return preparation space is not a violation of VSC #3 even if \nthat bank provides RACs/RALs as part of its overall business.\n56 Chapter 7: Volunteer Standards of Conduct\nThe partner operates a paid tax service in addition to having a VITA site in the same facility. The \nvolunteer reviews the income documents and determine the taxpayerâs total income is above the VITA \nincome limit. The volunteer then directs customers to their paid service for taxpayer convenience, so \nthey do not have to seek services elsewhere. You explain that this is a violation of VSC #3. Partner \nused taxpayer information gained during the Intake/Interview process for direct personal benefit to their \norganization.\nYour primary business includes selling health insurance policies. During the interview, you find out the \ntaxpayer lost access to health insurance in January of the current year. You cannot offer to sell the \ntaxpayer health insurance through your business.\nVSC #4 â Do not knowingly prepare false returns.\nIt is imperative that volunteers correctly apply tax law to the taxpayerâs situation. While it can be a temptation \nfor a volunteer to bend the law to help taxpayers, this will cause problems down the road for the taxpayers. \nVolunteers must not knowingly prepare false returns.\nTrust in the IRS and the local sponsoring organization is jeopardized when ethical standards are not followed. \nFraudulent returns can result in unwanted taxpayer interaction with the IRS. The taxpayer may be required to \npay additional tax, plus interest and penalties, resulting in an extreme burden. In addition, the taxpayer may \nseek damages under state or local law from the SPEC partner for the volunteerâs fraudulent actions. Even so, \nthe IRS would still seek payment of the additional taxes, interest, and penalties from the taxpayer.\nTo report suspected violations or concerns which you have emailing SPEC Headquarters at wi.voltax@\nirs.gov. The email should include your name, contact number, site name, and a detailed description of \nthe incident including the individualâs full name, date the incident occurred, and the number of taxpayers \naffected by the violation. \nA volunteer preparer told the taxpayer that cash income does not need to be reported. The return was \ncompleted without the cash income. The volunteer preparer has violated this standard. The quality \nreviewer simply missed this omission, and the return was printed, signed, and e-filed.\nThe quality reviewer missed this omission, and the return was printed, signed, and e-filed. Since the quality \nreviewer did not knowingly allow this return to be e-filed incorrectly, the quality reviewer did not violate this \nstandard. Do not to confuse an unethical action with a lack of knowledge or a simple mistake.\nA volunteer prepares a fraudulent return by knowingly claiming an ineligible dependent. The taxpayer \nreceived a notice from IRS disallowing the dependent and assessing additional taxes, interest, and \npenalties. The taxpayer may seek money from the SPEC partner, but must still pay the IRS the \nadditional taxes, interest, and penalties.\nA volunteer prepares a fraudulent return by adding Household Employee Wages that the taxpayer did \nnot earn. The taxpayer received a notice from IRS for additional information needed about the earnings \nthat the taxpayer did not have so the IRS corrected the tax return and began assessing additional \ntaxes, interest, and penalties. \nVSC #5 â Do not engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, notoriously disgraceful conduct, or \nany other conduct considered to have a negative effect on the VITA/TCE program.\nSPEC can prohibit volunteers from participating in the VITA/TCE program if they engage in criminal, infamous, \ndishonest, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, or any other conduct prejudicial to the government. Volunteers \nmust take care to avoid interactions that discredit the program. A taxpayer may look to state or local law to \nseek money from the SPEC partner for a volunteerâs fraudulent actions.",

    "text": "Chapter 7: Volunteer Standards of Conduct 57\nConsequences\nVolunteers performing egregious activities are barred from volunteering for the VITA/TCE program and may be \nadded to a registry of barred volunteers.\nAllowing an unauthorized alien to volunteer at a VITA/TCE site is prohibited. An âunauthorized alienâ is \ndefined as a person not lawfully admitted into the United States for either permanent residence or em-\nployment. All volunteers participating in the VITA/TCE program must legally reside in the United States. \nCoordinators are required to ask for proof of identity with a government-issued photo ID for each volunteer. \nHowever, coordinators or partners are not required to validate the legal status of volunteers. Therefore, by \nsigning Form 13615, volunteers are certifying that they are legal residents of the United States.\nVSC #6 â Treat all taxpayers in a professional, courteous, and respectful manner.\nTo safeguard public trust, Internal Revenue Service employees, partners, and volunteers must maintain the \nconfidence and respect of the people we serve. All volunteers must conduct themselves professionally in a \ncourteous, businesslike, and diplomatic manner.\nVolunteers take pride in assisting individuals who come to VITA/TCE sites for return preparation. Taxpayers \nare often under a lot of stress and may wait extended periods for assistance. Volunteers may also experience \nstress due to the volume of taxpayers needing service. This situation can make patience run short. It is \nimportant to remain calm and create a peaceful and friendly atmosphere.\nYou finish a difficult return for Millie, who has self-employment income, several expenses, and very few \nrecords. In addition, her son turned 25 and moved out early in the year. She owes the IRS about $50. After \nyou carefully explain the return, Millie sputters, âYou donât know what youâre doing. I always get a refund! My \nneighbor is self-employed, and she got $1,900 back.â In this situation, you should take a deep breath and \ncourteously explain that every return is different. If necessary, involve the coordinator.\nDue Diligence \nBy law, tax return preparers must exercise due diligence in preparing or assisting in the preparation of tax \nreturns. IRS defines due diligence as the degree of care and caution reasonably expected from, and ordinarily \nexercised by, a volunteer in the VITA/TCE program. This means, as a volunteer, you must do your part when \npreparing or quality reviewing a tax return to ensure the information on the return is correct and complete. \nDoing your part includes confirming a taxpayerâs (and/or spouse, if married filing jointly) identity and providing \ntop-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities. \nGenerally, IRS tax law certified volunteers may rely in good faith on information from a taxpayer without \nrequiring documentation as verification. However, part of due diligence requires volunteers to ask a taxpayer \nto clarify information that may appear to be inconsistent or incomplete. When reviewing information for its \naccuracy, volunteers need to ask themselves if the information is unusual or questionable.\nIf at any time a volunteer becomes uncomfortable with the information provided by the taxpayer, the \nvolunteer should not prepare the tax return. If necessary, ask the coordinator for assistance.\nFailure to Comply with the Volunteer Standards of Conduct \nWho enforces the standards?\nThe U.S. tax system is based on voluntary compliance. Most taxpayers compute their tax accurately, but at \ntimes unscrupulous taxpayers and preparers evade the system by filing fraudulent returns. For this reason, \nsome sponsoring organizations may perform background checks on their volunteers.\nThe VITA/TCE program is operated by sponsoring partners and/or coalitions outside the IRS. However, IRS \nis responsible for providing oversight to protect the VITA/TCE programsâ integrity and to maintain taxpayer \n58 Chapter 7: Volunteer Standards of Conduct\nconfidence. IRS recognizes the hard work volunteers contribute to the programs and does not want that \novershadowed by a volunteerâs lapse in judgment.\nHow are the standards enforced?\nIRS-SPEC continues to revise Form 13615, Volunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement, to provide guidance \nto volunteers and a structure for regulating ethical standards. By signing and dating Form 13615, Volunteer \nStandards of Conduct Agreement, volunteers agree that they will adhere to the VSC.\nIf conduct violating the standards occurs at a VITA/TCE site, IRS-SPEC will recommend corrective actions. If \nthe site cannot or will not remedy the conduct, then IRS-SPEC will discontinue its relationship and remove any \ngovernment property from the site.\nIn cases of wrongdoing, illegal conduct, and/or management practices that violate the VSC, IRS-SPEC \nmay terminate a VITA/TCE grant. A volunteerâs conduct could put a site or partner in jeopardy of losing its \ngovernment funding.\nResolving Problems\nIn general, the coordinator is the first point of contact for resolving any problems that a volunteer may encounter. \nIf a volunteer feels an ethical issue canât be handled by the coordinator, the volunteer should email SPEC \nheadquarters at wi.voltax@irs.gov and copy the partner and the local SPEC territory office as appropriate. The \nemail notification should include your name, contact number, site name, and a detailed description of the incident \nincluding the individuals full name, date the incident occurred, and the number of taxpayerâs affected by the \nviolation if applicable. The following chart lists common issues that a taxpayer may have and where they can be \nreferred. Publication 5136, Service Guide, also may be helpful when a taxpayer has a question unrelated to tax \npreparation.

    "text": "CHAPTER 8-1: Guidance for Potential Return Preparer Misconduct at VITA/TCE \nSites\nSPEC recognizes that most of our partners provide adequate oversight by ensuring volunteers exercise \ndue diligence when preparing or quality reviewing a tax return. To ensure SPEC and our partners have \nthe necessary tools to assist taxpayers who may be victims of Return Preparer Misconduct (RPM), SPEC \npartnered with the Identity Theft Victims Assistance (IDTVA) office to formalize SPECâs current procedures to \naddress RPM at VITA/TCE sites. Follow these procedures to handle those limited incidents where volunteer \nmisconduct occurs, and the taxpayer is harmed by not receiving their expected refund. This guidance \ncoordinates efforts between partners and IRS to ensure multiple sources do not provide reimbursement, such \nas receiving a refund from both the partner and the IRS.\nWhat is Return Preparer Misconduct?\nReturn Preparer Misconduct normally involves the orchestrated preparation and filing of false income tax \nreturns (in either paper or electronic form), including Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax \nReturn, by unscrupulous preparers who may change direct deposit information or claim, for example: inflated \npersonal or business expenses, false deductions, and fraudulent tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax \nCredit (EITC).\nPeriodically, the IDTVA office may receive claims from taxpayers regarding RPM at a VITA/TCE site. As \nappropriate, local SPEC territory offices work with partners to resolve taxpayersâ claims. If a partner alerts a \nSPEC employee of potential RPM at a VITA/TCE site, the territory office will attempt to determine if the error \nwas unintentional (a mistake) or intentional (without the taxpayerâs knowledge or consent). Partners with any \nquestions about these procedures or RPM, should contact their local SPEC territory office for assistance.\nWhat Can Be Expected From the IRS?\nThe IRS may provide relief to a taxpayer when, without the taxpayerâs knowledge or consent, the volunteer \nreturn preparer intentionally either altered a taxpayerâs tax return data or misdirected a portion or the entire \nrefund. The following are a couple of scenarios that could result in the IRS providing relief to a taxpayer:\nâ¢\t\nThe VITA/TCE volunteer income tax preparer prepared a correct return but intentionally misdirects the \nrefund by placing the volunteerâs bank account information on the tax return without the taxpayerâs \nknowledge or consent.\nâ¢\t\nThe taxpayer signs Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization, and receives the expected refund, \nbut later becomes aware of inflated items added but the taxpayer did not receive the inflated amount of \nthe refund.\nHow Can Partners Assist Taxpayers?\nPartners should assist taxpayers alleging preparer misconduct at VITA/TCE sites to complete Form 14157-A, \nTax Return Preparer Fraud or Misconduct Affidavit and Form 14157, Return Preparer Complaint.\nâ¢\t\nRefer to Form 14157-A, Tax Return Preparer Fraud or Misconduct Affidavit and Form 14157, Return \nPreparer Compliant.\nâ¢\t\nFollow the mailing instruction indicated on the Form 14157-A to submit the completed forms and \ndocumentation.\n60 CHAPTER 8: VITA/TCE Program Policies",

In general, the regulation requires tax return preparers (including \nvolunteer preparers, who intend to use or disclose a taxpayerâs tax return information for a purpose other \nthan current, prior, and subsequent return preparation) to obtain taxpayer consent and provide taxpayers \nwith specific information, including who will receive their tax return information and the items of tax return \ninformation disclosed or used.\nTreasury Regulation Section 301.7216-3 provides limited circumstances when, without first obtaining consent \nfrom the taxpayer, a tax return preparer may disclose or use a taxpayerâs tax return information other than to \nprepare a tax return. Some of the most common circumstances in the VITA/TCE program include:\nâ¢\t\nCompiling and using a list to solicit tax return preparation business\nâ¢\t\nPerforming legal or ethical conflict reviews\nâ¢\t\nDisclosing or using certain, limited statistical compilations\n62 CHAPTER 8: VITA/TCE Program Policies \nUnder the regulations, disclosure of a statistical compilation must be anonymous as to taxpayer \nidentities, meaning the compilation:\nâ¢\t\nDoes not include any personally identifiable information (PII), such as the taxpayerâs name, SSN/ITIN, \naddress, or other personal information\nâ¢\t\nDoes not disclose cells containing data from fewer than ten tax returns\nException: The regulations continue to require consent to use, or disclose, tax return information in marketing \nor advertising of statistical compilations containing or reflecting dollar amounts of refund, credit, or rebate, or \nrelating to percentages.\nUsing and Disclosing \nTaxpayer Information:\nRequires a Consent to Use?\nRequires a Consent to \nDisclose?\nRequires a signed paper \nconsent(s) if volunteers are \nentering the PIN?\nPreparing current, prior, or \nsubsequent year returns\nNo\nNo\nNo\nPurposes other than preparing \nprior, current, or subsequent year \nreturns\nYes\nYes\nYes\nReporting the number of returns \n(for example the number of \ntypes of returns such as Earned \nIncome Tax Credit or Child Tax \nCredit) prepared, for fundraising, \nmarketing, publicity, or other uses \nrelated to the volunteer site tax \nreturn preparation business.\nNo\nNo\nNo\nReporting any data containing \nreturn dollar amounts for \nmarketing or advertising or any \nother non-fundraising activities\nYes\nYes\nYes\nReporting any data containing \nreturn dollar amounts for \nfundraising activities\nNo\nNo\nNo\nGlobal Carry Forward Consents\nNo\nYes\nYes\nRelational EFIN Consents\nNo\nYes\nYes\nTax return preparers must obtain consent from the taxpayer before using or disclosing tax return information. \nSites must provide return preparation services regardless of the taxpayerâs decision.

    "text": "CHAPTER 8: VITA/TCE Program Policies  63\nRelational Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFIN)\nElectronic filing sites, using relational EFINs with their tax preparation software, must solicit consent to âDisclose.â \nThe relational EFIN process requires the tax preparation software provider share return data with a third party, the \nprimary sponsor. This sponsor must comply with IRC 7216 regulations. Since taxpayer data sharing occurs when \nelectronically filing, taxpayers must consent to disclose their data. If the taxpayer does not grant consent, or the \ntaxpayer does not enter a PIN and date at a VITA or non-Tax-Aide TCE site, the partner cannot e-file the return. \nThis is because the relational EFIN process shares the data with the preparing site and the primary sponsor \nduring acknowledgement. The only way to prevent data sharing is to stop the e-file.\nMandatory Consents to Disclose or Use Taxpayer Information\nRevenue Procedure 2013-14: Mandatory Consent Language\nprovides the mandatory language required in a consent to disclose or a consent to use tax return information \nwith respect to a Form 1040-series income tax return. A taxpayer need not sign consent to engage a tax return \npreparer to perform tax return preparation services if the preparer and taxpayer do not plan for the preparer to \ndisclose or use the taxpayerâs tax return information for any purpose other than preparing a return.\nMandatory Consents Statements \nPartners must include the following statements in consent. However, the tax return preparer may substitute the \npreparerâs name where the consent uses âweâ or âour.â\nConsent to âDiscloseâ (such as, financial aid, establishment of a bank account, other government \nagency assistance, or bank products) \nAll consent to disclose tax return information must contain the following statements in the following sequence:\nâ¢\t\nFederal law requires this consent form be provided to you. Unless authorized by law, we cannot \ndisclose your tax return information to third parties for purposes other than the preparation and filing \nof your tax return without your consent. If you consent to the disclosure of your tax return information, \nfederal law may not protect your tax return information from further use or distribution.\nâ¢\t\nYou do not have to complete this form to engage our tax return preparation services. If we obtain your \nsignature on this form by conditioning our tax return preparation services on your consent, your consent \nwill not be valid. If you agree to the disclosure of your tax return information, your consent is valid for \ntime that you specify. If you do not specify the duration of your consent, your consent is valid for one \nyear from the date of signature.\nâ¢\t\nIf you believe your tax return information has been disclosed or used improperly in a manner unauthorized \nby law or without your permission, you may contact the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration \n(TIGTA) by telephone at 1-800-366-4484, or by email at complaints@tigta.treas.gov.\nConsent to âUseâ (such as, financial aid, establishment of a bank account, other government agency \nassistance, or bank products) \nAll consents to use tax return information must contain the following statements in the following sequence:\nâ¢\t\nFederal law requires this consent form be provided to you. Unless authorized by law, we cannot use \nyour tax return information for purposes other than the preparation and filing of your tax return without \nyour consent.\nâ¢\t\nYou do not have to complete this form to engage our tax return preparation services. If we obtain your \nsignature on this form by conditioning our tax return preparation services on your consent, your consent \nwill not be valid. Your consent is valid for time that you specify. If you do not specify the duration of your \nconsent, your consent is valid for one year from the date of signature.\nIf you believe your tax return information has been disclosed or used improperly in a manner unauthorized by law \nor without your permission, you may contact the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) by \ntelephone at 1-800-366-4484, or by email at complaints@tigta.treas.gov.\nMultiple Disclosures or Uses Within a Single Consent Form\n64 CHAPTER 8: VITA/TCE Program Policies \nTreasury Regulations section 301.7216-3(c)(1) provides that a taxpayer may consent to multiple uses within \nthe same written document or multiple disclosures within the same written document. Multiple disclosure \nconsents and multiple use consents must provide the taxpayer with the opportunity, within the separate written \ndocument, to affirmatively select (accept/reject) each separate disclosure or use. Partners must provide:\nâ¢\t\nDisclosure consents and use consents in separate documents.\nâ¢\t\nTaxpayer with the mandatory consent language for each separate disclosure or use.\nThe mandatory statements need only be stated once in a multiple disclosure or multiple use consent.\nDisclosure of Entire Return\nIf consent authorizes the disclosure of a copy of the taxpayerâs entire tax return or all information contained \nwithin a return, the consent must provide that the taxpayer could request a more limited disclosure of tax return \ninformation as the taxpayer may direct.\nElectronic Signature Requirements\nRevenue Procedure 2013-14 provides specific requirements applicable to a taxpayerâs electronic signature \nto consent, to disclose or use the taxpayerâs tax return information. The taxpayer must sign by an affirmative \n(physical) action all consents to disclose or use tax return information. A verbal consent is not an affirmative \naction and therefore not acceptable as a valid consent. Additional comments include:â\nâ¢\t\nFor electronic consents, a tax return preparer must obtain a taxpayerâs signature on the consent by one \nof the following methods. \nConsult your software provider to determine which method(s) is/are available in your tax preparation \nsoftware. Not all software providers support all methods.\n\t\nâ\nPreparers may assign a personal identification number (PIN) that is at least 5 characters long \nto the taxpayer. To authorize the consent, the taxpayer may type in the pre-assigned PIN as the \ntaxpayerâs signature authorizing the disclosure or use. The taxpayer must affirmatively (physically) \nenter the PIN for the electronic signature to be valid,\n\t\nâ\nHave the taxpayer type in the taxpayerâs name and then hit âenterâ to authorize the consent. The \ntaxpayer must affirmatively (physically) type the taxpayerâs name for the electronic consent to be \nvalid, or \n\t\nâ\nAny other way the taxpayer affirmatively (physically) enters 5 or more characters unique to the \ntaxpayer that the tax return preparer uses to verify the taxpayerâs identity. For example, entry of a \nresponse to a question regarding a shared secret (such as motherâs maiden name, favorite color, a \nsignificant date, etc.) could be the type of information by which the taxpayer authorizes disclosure \nor use of tax return information.\nIf the preparer is entering the consent PIN and date into the tax preparation software, the taxpayer must sign \nand date a paper consent form before the preparer enters the consent PIN and date into the tax preparation \nsoftware. The site may give the signed paper consent form to the taxpayer or maintain at the site. Whether you \ngive the taxpayer a signed copy or maintain it at the site, you must provide the taxpayer a copy of the consent \nform from the tax preparation software with the PIN for their records.\nSee the TaxSlayer User Guide for information on IRC 7216 consents available using \nTaxSlayer.",

An accommodation is any change made to a practice, policy, or \nprocedure that allows persons with disabilities equal access to programs and activities.â\nWhen a taxpayer requests an accommodation, the site must determine the accommodation needed, whether it \nis reasonable, and if available. If a siteâs representative must deny a request for a specific accommodation \nbecause it is not reasonable, discuss with the taxpayer alternative accommodations that would remove the \nbarrier to service.â\nDisabilities are not always visible.â\nCoordinator Fact Sheets/Civil Rights Unit (CRU) Advisories covering reasonable accommodations can be \nfound on the Site Coordinator Corner or by contacting your local SPEC territory office. Also, see Chapter 9: \nServing Taxpayers with Disabilities, for more information.â\nProviding Language Assistance\nTaxpayers with limited English proficiency (LEP) may require language assistance to participate in, or receive \nthe benefits from, a program or activity supported by the IRS. Language assistance may include both oral \n(interpretation) and written (translation) services.â\nSites must take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by persons with \nLEP. In determining what constitutes reasonable steps, sites should conduct an individualized assessment that \nbalances the following four factors: â\nâ¢\t\nThe number or proportion of LEP persons eligible for service or likely to be encountered\nâ¢\t\nThe frequency with which persons with LEP come into the program\nâ¢\t\nThe nature and importance of the service provided by the program to peopleâs lives\nâ¢\t\nThe available resources\nUsing Demographic Data to Prepare for Reasonable Accommodation and Language Assistance \nRequests\nPrior to each filing season, partners should assess the demographic makeup of their service areas, so their \nsites are prepared to respond to requests for accommodation and language assistance.\nThere are several sources for demographic data regarding the LEP population.

Refer to Publication 1101, Application Package and Guidelines \nfor Managing a TCE Program, and Exhibit 2 in Publication 4671, Helping You Help Others VITA Grant Program \nOverview and Application Instructions, for the âList of Assurances and Certifications.â\nGrant recipients must retain all financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other \nrecords pertinent to an award for a period of three years from the final submission date for the grant cycle. \nAdditional guidance is available in Publication 4883, Grant Programs Resource Guide for VITA Volunteer \nIncome Tax Assistance & TCE Tax Counseling for the Elderly, or by contacting the IRS VITA Grant Office at \nGrant.Program.Office@irs.gov for more information.\nData Collection Requirements\nCurrently, recipients of federal financial assistance from the Department of the Treasury must adhere to legal \nrequirements ensuring entities receiving federal financial assistance from the treasury do not deny benefits \nor services, or otherwise discriminate based on race, color, national origin, disability, and age, or based on \nsex in educational programs and activities. To carry out its enforcement responsibilities, the department must \nobtain a signed assurance of compliance, and collect and review information from recipients to determine their \nadherence with applicable requirements before and after providing financial assistance (see 31 CFR 22.5, 22.6 \nand 28 CFR 42.406).\nIn accordance with the Title VI regulations (see 31 CFR 22), the Department of the Treasury is authorized to \nrequest data from its recipients. Those applying to receive financial assistance from the Department of the \nTreasury will request recipients to submit a Title VI narrative describing their compliance status at the time of \nthe application for assistance. The department will also request recipients to submit data during post-award \ncompliance reviews. Please note: Treasury will make available sample policies and procedures to assist \nrecipients in completing these requests for data and will provide technical assistance directly to recipients as \nneeded.\nThe purpose of the information collection is to advise recipients of their civil rights obligation, obtain an \nassurance of compliance from each recipient, and collect pertinent civil rights information to determine if \nthe recipient has adequate policies and procedures in place to achieve adherence, and to determine if any, \nfurther action may be needed (technical assistance, training, compliance review, etc.) to ensure the recipient \nis in compliance and will carry out its programs and activities in a nondiscriminatory manner. Treasury will \nalso collect civil rights related information from all primary recipients of federal financial assistance from the \ndepartment. Primary recipients are non-federal entities that receive federal financial assistance in the form \nof a grant, cooperative agreement, or other type of financial assistance directly from the department and not \nthrough another recipient or âpass-throughâ entity. Please note: This information collection does not apply to \nsub-recipients, federal contractors (unless the contract includes the provision of financial assistance), nor the \nultimate beneficiaries of services, financial aid, or other benefits from the department.\nMany recipients already collect information, including race and national origin data, or the beneficiaries that \nreceive tax preparation assistance. Recipients will also be required to provide information with their application \nfor federal financial assistance. Treasury anticipates data, records, or files used to respond to information \n68 CHAPTER 8: VITA/TCE Program Policies \ncollections are already maintained in electronic format by the recipient. Therefore, providing information \nelectronically will further minimize administrative burden. Treasury will also allow recipients to scan and \nsubmit documents not already maintained electronically. If the recipient is unable to submit their information \nelectronically, alternative arrangements will be made to submit responses in hard copy.\nRecipients can submit comments to the Office of Civil Rights and Compliance (OCRC) concerning data \ncollection for civil rights compliance and enforcement purposes under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and similar \nstatutes applicable to federal financial assistance, by emailing civil.rights.division@irs.gov.\nHow to Make a Civil Rights Complaint\nIf a taxpayer believes discrimination occurred based on race, color, national origin (including LEP), disability, \nsex (in education programs or activities), age or reprisal, they can file a complaint. Send written complaints to:\nInternal Revenue Service \nCivil Rights Unit\n1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room 2413\nWashington, DC 20224\nFor all inquiries concerning taxpayer civil rights, contact IRS at the address referenced above or email civil.\nrights.division@irs.gov\nServing Taxpayers with Disabilities  69",

In doing so, partners can support their VITA/TCE sites in achieving the highest quality \nservice. This is also conducive to having a successful filing season in a consistent and ethical manner.â\nPartners recognize volunteer efforts and host end of the filing season appreciation ceremonies to acknowledge \nvolunteer contributions to the VITA/TCE program. IRS employees volunteer their time to provide free tax \npreparation for their communities. Partners need to understand the guidelines for IRS employees attending \nVITA/TCE recognition ceremonies or other partner sponsored events.â\nThe Department of the Treasury ethics rules prohibit IRS employees from engaging in the preparation of tax \nreturns for compensation, gift, or favor. IRS employee volunteer efforts must remain 100% uncompensated. \nIRS employees must reject any compensation, gift, or favor. If they do not reject these items, the IRS employee \nmust reimburse the partner for any items provided to them as recognition for their volunteer tax preparation \nefforts. This is regardless of the value. For example, during a recognition ceremony, the partner provides all \nvolunteers with a $10 gift card to thank them for their volunteer work. IRS employees must decline any gift \ncard, regardless of the amount. Additionally, if there is any type of raffle or drawing at the recognition event, \nIRS employees must decline participation or receipt of any item.â\nPartners may include IRS employees when recognizing volunteer tax preparation efforts if whatever items \nprovided to them are part of a group recognition celebrating the successes of the filing season. For example, \nIRS employees may accept a certificate of appreciation issued to all volunteers each year by the SPEC office. \nIRS employees may also accept a pin given to all volunteers who reach certain milestones of service. They \nmay enjoy the food and drinks offered at an end-of-season reception open to all volunteers if not prohibited \nunder the general restrictions applying to IRS employees for accepting gifts. IRS employees may also enjoy \nlight snacks while volunteering because these items directly support tax assistance efforts.â\nPartners may provide cash reimbursement for travel expenses to IRS employees who volunteer as \ncoordinators.â\nServing Taxpayers with Disabilities",

    "text": "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that people with disabilities have equal access to tax preparation \nservices provided through the VITA/TCE program. To help ensure equal access, you should evaluate the \navailability of resources and consider the type of reasonable accommodations that taxpayers with a disability \nmay request. It is important to recognize that not all people with similar disabilities require the same \naccommodations, and sometimes, you must be flexible and creative. As with the tax preparation process, allow \nyour interview to guide you through the process of giving the help needed. If there are any questions about \nwhether to approve or deny a request for an accommodation, you can consult with the IRS Civil Rights Unit at \nedi.crd.ra@irs.gov. \nReasonable and effective alternative accommodations that allow equal access is a requirement for \ntaxpayers with a disability. If you deny a request for an accommodation and the taxpayer challenges the \ndenial, you must be able to show that granting the accommodation would cause an undue hardship or \nfundamental alteration to your program.â\nAdditional References:\nâ¢\t\nPublication 5192, Ten Key Points for Communicating with People with Disabilities\nâ¢\t\nPublication 5231, Key Points for Communicating with People who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing\nâ¢\t\nSite Coordinator Corner, Fact Sheets and Civil Rights Unit Advisories\nServing Taxpayers with Mobility Impairments\n70 Serving Taxpayers with Disabilities \nTo prepare your site for the upcoming season, make sure that you and your volunteers are familiar with \nphysical barriers that would prevent taxpayers with limited mobility from being able to navigate the site. Take \nproactive measures to address the following barriers:\nâ¢\t\nAre there steps leading into the building that would prevent wheelchair access? If so, is there an \nalternate entrance at street level or a ramp available for wheelchair access? If an alternate entrance is \navailable, are there signs at the main entrance informing taxpayers of the accessible entrance?\nâ¢\t\nAre doorways wide enough to accommodate a person in a wheelchair?\nâ¢\t\nIf the site provides restrooms, are they accessible for people with disabilities?\nâ¢\t\nIs there enough space around a tax preparation station to allow for wheelchair access?\nâ¢\t\nAre there tax preparation stations on the ground floor of the building, or is there elevator access to \nother floors?\nServing Taxpayers Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision\nTaxpayers who are blind or who have low vision may face unique challenges when completing Form 13614-C:\nâ¢\t\nFor taxpayers who can read printed materials, enlarging a copy of Form 13614-C, Intake Interview and \nIntake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, may be the only accommodation necessary.\nâ¢\t\nFor taxpayers who cannot read print, offer to have a volunteer greeter or preparer read Form 13614-C \nto the taxpayer and record their answers.\nâ¢\t\nIf the taxpayer has called ahead for an appointment, schedulers may offer to send the taxpayer a link \nto Form 13614-C within an email. Many taxpayers who are blind or low vision have access to special \ntechnology that will allow them to complete the form on their own computers.\nâ¢\t\nWhen reviewing a tax return with a taxpayer who is blind, the reviewer should be prepared to verbally \nread the key information to the taxpayer, rather than pointing to the information. Consider finding a \nprivate space to read this information aloud. Taxpayers can usually offer suggestions about the best \nway you can help them. \nServing Taxpayers with Disabilities  71\nServing Taxpayers Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing\nTaxpayers who are deaf or hard of hearing have varying ranges of language skills and abilities. Some can \ncommunicate verbally with you, while others cannot. Some can read lips, and some communicate with \nEnglish Exact Sign which is a method of sign language that mimics the English language precisely as spoken. \nHowever, most taxpayers who are deaf or hard of hearing communicate with American Sign Language (ASL). \nConsider the following items when working with taxpayers who are either deaf or hard of hearing:\nâ¢\t\nBe aware ASL is different from spoken English as both languages differ in vocabulary and grammar. \nTherefore, do not assume that simply writing notes between yourself and the taxpayer is an acceptable \nmeans of communicating important and specific information needed to prepare a complete and \naccurate tax return. Writing notes, however, can be helpful for basic interactions such as obtaining \ntaxpayer contact information and arranging for the provision of a sign language interpreter.\nâ¢\t\nHave a certified or licensed ASL interpreter (requirements may vary from state to state) available to \naid taxpayers who request such an accommodation. Find organizations in or near your community that \nmay be able to help supply interpreter services.\nâ¢\t\nAllow time to coordinate schedules with both the taxpayer and the interpreter. You may not be able to \nimmediately obtain interpreter services.\nâ¢\t\nAllow more time when preparing returns for someone who requires an interpreter. The communication \nof information through a third party often means preparation time will be longer than usual.\nâ¢\t\nConsider offering interpreter services to taxpayers because taxpayers may not want family members \nor friends to know their personal tax information. Taxpayers may choose to bring someone they trust to \ninterpret for them, but this should not be your first solution. It is their right to expect the same level of \nprivacy and confidentiality any taxpayer would receive through the provision of a qualified interpreter.\nâ¢\t\nDecide the best place to accommodate the tax preparer, the taxpayer, and the interpreter, comfortably. \nThe taxpayer should always be able to see the interpreter.\nâ¢\t\nSpeak directly to the taxpayer, not to the interpreter. For instance, it is not proper to ask the interpreter, \nâCan you ask him if he brought a blank check so we can enter his bank information for direct deposit?â \nInstead, ask the taxpayer, âDid you bring a blank check so we can enter your bank information for direct \ndeposit?â This can be challenging for volunteers who have not worked with an interpreter on behalf of a \ntaxpayer.\nâ¢\t\nSupply some degree of visual privacy when preparing returns for taxpayers who are deaf, especially \nwhen multiple sign language users are present in the same space. Sign language is visual \nconversation.\nâ¢\t\nProvide a quiet private space to maximize comprehension and minimize confusion when possible. \nBackground noise can be distracting and make it difficult for a taxpayer who is hard of hearing to \nunderstand what you say.\nâ¢\t\nAvoid covering your mouth or looking away when speaking to taxpayers who are hard of hearing. \nThese taxpayers may be relying, in part, on reading lips to receive the information you are presenting. \nTurning away from them can affect their ability to do such.\nâ¢\t\nUse a consistent volume when speaking to taxpayers who are hard of hearing.\nâ¢\t\nRemember, individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, but are verbal, might not understand you while \nyou are wearing a mask. They may normally lip read to understand. However, we do not recommend \nremoving your mask. You need to ask what communication methods work best for them. \n72 Serving Taxpayers with Disabilities \nHelpful Suggestions in Obtaining Interpreters\nâ¢\t\nContact the university near you that teaches sign language and ask for a graduate student or an \nexperienced student volunteer. Many schools are looking to partner with organizations so that their \nsenior level students can get credit hours for volunteer work.\nâ¢\t\nContact a partner with a local organization whose mission is to establish and maintain a network of \nservices for the deaf, hard-of-hearing, late deafened (hearing loss occurring after childhood), and deaf-\nblind.\nPartners that receive federal funded grants represent less than 10% of our total partners, so the cost for paying \nfor interpreter services may not be reasonable for a non-grant funded VITA/TCE partner depending on the \ncircumstances. However, some have processes in place, but this may result in rescheduling an appointment \nwith the taxpayer to meet with the interpreter. Even grant funded partners may have to reschedule an \nappointment for supplying these services because interpreters may not be at the site full time.\nAll volunteer interpreters must certify in the Volunteer Standards of Conduct. However, there is no \nrequirement to be tax law certified.\nAmerican Sign Language Video Resources\nSPEC partners with the National Disability Institute and National Association of the Deaf. SPEC identified \nthe need to provide more information regarding free tax preparation services for deaf and hard of hearing \ntaxpayers who use ASL as their primary language. SPEC has created a series of ASL videos describing the \nreturn preparation process available at VITA/TCE sites. These videos help volunteers who serve as ASL \ninterpreters and are useful for anyone wanting to become more familiar with the tax preparation process.â\nThe videos are on IRS.gov at American Sign Language (ASL) Videos",

The Virtual VITA/TCE approach uses the same \nprocesses as traditional VITA/TCE except the IRS-certified volunteers use approved virtual communication \nchannels to interact with the taxpayer(s). Virtual communication may occur during the intake, interview, return \npreparation, or quality review processes. SPEC provides detailed guidance in Publication 5450, VITA/TCE Site \nOperations, regarding virtual return preparation models.â\nVolunteers must follow all Quality Site Requirements (QSR) and adhere to the Volunteer Standards Conduct \n(VSC) when preparing returns using virtual models. Partners must apply the QSR to all alternative filing \nmodels. SPEC provides guidance on the differences (from traditional face to face tax preparation models) in \napplying the QSR to alternative filing models in Publication 5324, Fact Sheet: Quality Site Requirements for \nAlternative Filing Models for SPEC Partners and Employees. Sites must use caution when using these virtual \nchannels to ensure taxpayer data and identity information is not compromised during the tax preparation \nprocess.  Best practices include, providing the taxpayer(s) a personal password or identifier that the siteâs \nvolunteers can use throughout the return preparation process. The partner and/or coordinator should also \ndevelop a strong security process limiting volunteer security roles in the tax preparation software to protect \naccess to all taxpayer personally identifiable information (PII) regardless of where return preparation and \nquality review takes place. Volunteers must review and adhere to privacy and security guidelines outlined in \nPublication 4299.â\nCounting of Returns with EFIN and SIDN\nThe preparation site utilizes its own electronic filing identification number (EFIN) to electronically file the \nreturns. TaxSlayer reports reflect these totals as credited to the preparation site. The preparation site will also \nutilize its own site identification number (SIDN) on all returns prepared under virtual VITA/TCE.\nException: Partners who wish to continue utilizing the intake site SIDN as a tool to monitor the effectiveness \nof their virtual service locations must document their request for exception in Form 15272, VITA/TCE Security \nPlan, Section II - Virtual VITA/TCE Process.",

Also, the responsible official will receive a letter in 14 days showing the new EFIN(s) assigned.\nContact the e-help Desk at (866) 255-0654, for assistance with the IRS e-file Application.\nApplication Types\nThere are three e-file application types:\n\ty\nNew: A partner will need to complete a new e-file application if the partner is opening a new site or if \nthe partner is new to the VITA/TCE program.\n\ty\nRevised: A partner would need to revise an e-file application if any information on an EFIN account \nhas changed. You must submit changes within 30 days of any change. The responsible official \nmakes changes online. SPEC encourages partners to have at least two responsible officials. Anyone \nlisted on the application as the responsible official can log in through e-Services and make updates \nto the application, including adding an additional responsible official. Each responsible official must \nindividually register for e-Services before the program adds them to an existing e-file application.\n\ty\nReapply: If the EFIN status shows and the partner wishes to continue in the IRS e-file program, the \nresponsible official must reapply and will receive a new EFIN.The EFIN status can be Active, Inactive, \nor Dropped. Below are reasons why your EFIN shows an Inactive status:â\nâ¢\t\nEvery year there is an âEFIN Cleanupâ project where any EFIN not used to prepare/submit at least one \nelectronically filed return in two years is systemically inactivated. e-Services puts the EFIN in Inactive \nstatus and drops provider options. e-Services mails Letter 3250-C, ERO Deactivation Letter, to each \nmailing address on record notifying the site that the EFIN is no longer active due to non-use. If they \nwish to have the EFIN remain active, they must contact the e-help desk within 30 days.\nâ¢\t\nEFIN cleanup begins in May of each year and the drop date is sometime in the fall (which is why you \nfrequently see EFINs dropped in November). It is critical to monitor all sites continuously, especially \nfrom November through January to ensure you have an active EFIN. \nâ¢\t\nWhen e-Services receives information that a person is deceased, they perform analysis for any \nassociated EFINs. Partners must remove and replace deceased individuals listed on the application \n76 CHAPTER 10: Tax Return Preparation, e-Services and TaxSlayer \nwithin 30 days. After that, e-Services places the EFIN in âinactiveâ status.\nâ¢\t\nIf the deactivation letter returned by the postal service as undeliverable or there is no response to \ncorrespondence, e-Services creates an e-help support ticket and forwards it to SPEC headquarters \nrequesting the correct year-round address and alternate contact information. e-Services places the \nEFIN in inactive status until corrected.\nâ¢\t\nIf e-Services receives no response within the 30-day timeframe, they systemically drop the EFIN \n(usually 60 days later).\n\t\nYou cannot reactivate a Dropped EFIN, update or use it again. E-Services may systematically reassign \ndropped EFINs to another provider after 12 months.\nSPEC Territory Office Responsibility\nPartners may contact their local SPEC territory office for referrals regarding: \n\ty\nAssociating a responsible official with an existing EFIN application: If a partner has an EFIN but \nthe responsible official is not registered in e-Services, they will need to register for e-Services and then \nprovide their local SPEC territory office with the following information: Name, Position Title, U.S. Citizen \nStatus, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, and email address.\n\ty\nAdding a second responsible official to an existing EFIN application: If a responsible official \nregistered in e-Services has an EFIN, but wants to add a secondary responsible official, first the \npotential secondary responsible official needs to register for e-Services. Once confirmed, they must \nprovide their local SPEC territory office with the following information: Name, Position Title, U.S. Citizen \nStatus, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, and email address.\n\ty\nDeleting a responsible official from an existing EFIN application: If the responsible official for an \nexisting EFIN application is no longer working in the VITA/TCE program, the partner will need to find a \nreplacement responsible official, have the responsible official register for e-Services, and then provide \ntheir local SPEC territory office with the following information: Name, Position Title, U.S. Citizen Status, \nSocial Security Number, Date of Birth, and Email address.\nDo not contact the territory office if the volunteer is having problems registering for e-Services. Instead, \nthe volunteer should contact the e-help desk for assistance at 1-866-255-0654.\n \nVerifying the New e-file Application\nOnce e-Services accepts the application and assigns an EFIN, the partner must provide their local SPEC \nterritory office relationship manager with the EFIN to update the SPEC database.\nRevising the e-file Application\nPartners have the responsibility to ensure input of revisions and updates in the e-file application within 30 days \nof any changes to their current application, such as:\nâ¢\t\nFirm/Site name\nâ¢\t\nPhysical Address\nâ¢\t\nMailing Address\nâ¢\t\nYear-Round Address\nâ¢\t\nTelephone Numbers\nâ¢\t\nEmail Addresses\nâ¢\t\nContact Persons\nâ¢\t\nResponsible Official (remove if no longer with the site or deceased)\nâ¢\t\nAuthorized Users\nWhen adding new responsible officials to an existing application, the application status moves to \nResubmission Required.

When importing carry forward data, the volunteer must carefully \nreview the imported data to ensure it matches the current Form 13614-C.\nTaxSlayer Consent Form Requirements Per IRC 7216\nThis section provides information about how to apply consents within the TaxSlayer tax preparation software. \nTaxpayers using volunteer sites will need to consent annually on whether they want their tax return information \ndisclosed or used. Taxpayers must affirmatively consent during the return preparation process for partners/\nsites using or disclosing taxpayer data for purposes other than current, prior, or subsequent year tax return \npreparation. For a married filing joint return, both taxpayers must either grant or deny the consent (they both \nmust agree). If the taxpayer does not sign a paper consent, then the taxpayer must enter his or her own PIN \nin the tax preparation software. IRC 7216 rules apply based on use or disclosure of taxpayer data for the \nfollowing consents:\nâ¢\t\nGlobal Carry Forward\nâ¢\t\nRelational\nâ¢\t\nUse\nâ¢\t\nDisclose\nVITA/TCE Site Responsibility\nBased on IRC 7216, if the return preparer is entering the consent PIN and date into the tax preparation software, \nthe taxpayer must sign and date a paper consent form before the consent PIN and date are entered. â\nMany taxpayers do not want to enter their own PIN; therefore, you must do a paper consent for sites when the \nreturn preparer is entering the consent PIN on behalf of the taxpayer.\nThere are two options a site can use for taxpayers to sign a consent:â\n84 CHAPTER 10: Tax Return Preparation, e-Services and TaxSlayer \nâ¢\t\nElectronic only â Taxpayer reviews the consent on the computer and enter his or her own PIN in the tax \npreparation software.\nâ¢\t\nPaper and electronic â The preparer enters the PIN on behalf of the taxpayer into the tax preparation \nsoftware. If the preparer is entering the consent PIN and date into the tax preparation software, the taxpayer \nmust sign and date a paper consent form before the preparer enters the PIN and date into the software.\nRetention Requirement\nThe site may give the signed paper consent form to the taxpayer or maintain it at the site. Whether you give \nthe signed copy to the taxpayer or maintain it at the site, you must provide the taxpayer a copy of the consent \nfrom the electronic tax preparation software with the PIN for their records.\nGlobal Carry Forward\nGlobal Carry Forward consent allows all tax returns prepared within one VITA/TCE site to be available to all \nVITA/TCE sites. Taxpayers must affirmatively consent during the tax return preparation process to allow their \ninformation to be available for global carry forward in the subsequent tax year. A taxpayer who consents will \nbe able to visit any VITA/TCE site in the subsequent year and the site will be able to populate the return with \ndata from the prior year. However, if taxpayers do not choose to have their tax return data carried forward, they \ncannot be denied service.â\nBased on an agreement with SPEC, TaxSlayer embeds the electronic version of the Global consent into all \nOnline VITA/TCE software packages. Partners cannot edit or delete it. If the taxpayer grants consent, the data \nwill be available to all VITA/TCE sites during the subsequent filing season.â\nSPEC developed Form 15080, Consent to Disclose Tax Return Information to VITA/TCE Tax Preparation Sites, \nfor Global Carryforward consent. Form 15080 is printable in TaxSlayer and required if the return preparer is \nentering the granted consent PIN and date into the tax preparation software on the taxpayerâs behalf. Do not \nuse Form 15080 if the taxpayer does not consent to the Global Carryforward of return data to all sites or if the \ntaxpayer(s) enters their own PIN into the tax preparation software.â\nThe English and Spanish versions of Form 13614-C include Form 15080. The electronic versions of Form \n13614-C include Form 15080 in the following languages: Spanish, Bengali, Persian/Farsi, German, Gujarati, \nItalian, Japanese, Khmer, Punjabi, Somali, Urdu, Haitian Creole, Arabic, Chinese-Simplified, Chinese-\nTraditional, French, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Tagalog and Vietnamese.â  \nRelational EFIN\nIf the site has a Relational EFIN, TaxSlayer adds the consent form to the software when processing the order. \nThe taxpayerâs acceptance on the Relational EFIN consent allows TaxSlayer to accept the return for e-filing. \nThese consents provide the site with the ability to see reporting data for all EFINs under the relational (primary) \nEFIN. If the taxpayer denies consent or the preparer enters no PIN/date at a VITA or non-Tax-Aide TCE site, \nthe taxpayer must file a paper return with the IRS for processing. TaxSlayer will exclude all return data from \nreporting at the Relational EFIN level.â\nIf a partner has a Relational EFIN, TaxSlayer will embed this form into the tax software. Based on IRC 7216 \nguidelines, TaxSlayer has included the mandatory use/disclosure language on the Relational consent. Partners \ncannot delete or edit it.\nUse and Disclose\nThe Use and Disclose consent forms allow the site to use aggregate return data for statistical purposes and \nwill require consents to Use and Disclose based on IRC 7216. For data used only for this purpose, the site will \nneed to add these forms during setup. The site must not check the ârequiredâ box for these generic Use and \nDisclose forms because this makes the return appear as part of a Relational EFIN and, if the taxpayer denies \nconsent, it will cause a rejected return if electronically filed.\nTaxSlayer Reports and Descriptions 85\nThere will be two forms required for Use and Disclosure for non-relational EFIN. Partners/sites must add these \nconsents during the site setup process. Name one form âConsent to Use Personal Tax Return Informationâ and \nthe other âConsent to Disclose Personal Tax Return Information.â If a taxpayer denies either of these consents, \nthe site can still electronically submit the return.\nNon-Relational Denied Consents\nPer IRC 7216, the taxpayer does not sign anything (paper or electronic) for a denied consent. If the taxpayer \ndenies consent for a non-relational EFIN, there is no need for PIN or date, and the taxpayer can file \nelectronically.â\nIf the preparer marks accept and does not enter a PIN or date, the application will generate an error \nmessage and the preparer must:\nâ¢\t\nEnter the PIN and date, or \nâ¢\t\nChange the consent to denied,\nTaxSlayer considers the consent denied if there is no PIN and date entered.\nSee Publication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality and Civil Rights - A Public Trust, for guidance on consent forms \nfor VITA/TCE sites.\nPrior Year Software Access\nTaxSlayer Pro Online and Desktop software gives sites the ability to prepare federal, state, and local individual \ntax returns for the previous five tax years (TY2023, TY2022, TY2021, TY2020 and TY2019). Sites can \nelectronically file federal and participating state individual tax returns for the previous two years (TY2023 and \nTY2022).\nPrior Year Return Preparation\nSPEC encourages VITA/TCE sites with the necessary software and reference materials to prepare prior year \nreturns. Complete a current Form 13614-C, Intake, Interview and Quality Review Sheet, for all prior year \nreturns. Use it to determine the required certification level and if the return is within scope of the VITA/TCE \nprogram. IRS-certified volunteers can prepare prior-year returns at the same tax law certification level as \nobtained in the current year. All prior year tax returns must be prepared using tax preparation software. Use \nevery effort to secure experienced volunteers (at least two years) for preparing these types of tax returns.\nâ¢\t\nModernized e-file allows electronic filing of prior year returns. It accepts the current tax year along with \ntwo prior year tax returns.\nâ¢\t\nUse the correct SIDN and EFIN to ensure your site receives credit for preparing these types of tax \nreturns.\nâ¢\t\nUse a prior year Form 13614-C as a reference tool but do not replace the use of a current form. This \nwill ensure no credits are overlooked.\nâ¢\t\nRefer to the Prior Year Return Job Aid in Publication 4012, Volunteer Resource Guide for additional \nassistance.\nAmended Return Preparation\nIRS-certified volunteers can prepare amended returns for current and prior year tax returns at the same tax law \ncertification level as obtained in the current year. VITA/TCE sites may prepare amended returns even if they \ndid not prepare the original return. As with prior year returns, SPEC encourages partners to assign amended \nreturns to experienced IRS-certified volunteers. Amended returns must be prepared using tax preparation \nsoftware. The taxpayer must have the original return and adequate information for preparing these returns. \nRefer to the Amended Return Job Aid available in Publication 4012.\n \nTaxSlayer Reports and Descriptions\nThe data collected from TaxSlayer is one of the primary tools for the VITA/TCE program to measure success \nf\nS\nf\n86 TaxSlayer Reports and Descriptions\nE-file Reports: \nTransmission Confirmation: The Transmission Confirmation Report confirms that a transmission \nwas received by the TaxSlayer server.

    "text": "CHAPTER 11: Types of Site Reviews\nIRS conducts reviews of VITA/TCE sites to ensure quality and accuracy of tax returns prepared by volunteers \nand site performance. Below you will find descriptions of the most common site quality and IRS reviews.â\nField Site Visits (FSV)\nField Site Visits (FSV) are critical to the oversight of the VITA/TCE program and play an integral role in \nimproving the quality of service provided at volunteer sites. SPEC conducts site and return reviews during FSV \nto measure adherence to the Quality Site Requirements (QSR) and Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC). \nFSV are NOT audits but assistance visits. These visits are opportunities for the local SPEC territory office to \naid or offer guidance, identify, and share best practices, and strengthen adherence to the QSR. FSV are critical \nfor SPEC to identify trending issues and monitor site operations. In addition to providing an overview of site \noperations, FSV provide an opportunity for the partner or coordinator to ask questions and request assistance. \nYour relationship manager (RM) or another tax consultant (TC) in the SPEC organization normally conducts \nthese unannounced visits when you are open.\nRemote Site Reviews (RSR)\nSPEC considers Remote Site Reviews (RSR) as VITA/TCE program oversight reviews conducted via phone, \nemail, correspondence, or other virtual means. RSR allow SPEC to reach more partners and coordinators \nduring the filing season. Like FSV, SPEC conducts RSR to measure adherence to Quality Site Requirements \n(QSR) and Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC). RSR are not audits. Same as with FSV, these reviews \nare opportunities for the local SPEC territory office to aid or offer guidance, identify, and share best practices, \nand strengthen adherence to the QSR. RSR are critical for SPEC to identify trending issues and monitor site \noperations. Prior to conducting the remote review, TC will contact the coordinator to schedule the review for \na time which is convenient for the partner or coordinator. This review can be conducted after site operating \nhours. In addition to providing an overview of site operations, RSR provide an opportunity for the partner or \ncoordinator to ask questions and request assistance. RSR are announced reviews. \nQuality Statistical Sample (QSS) Reviews\nAnalysts assigned to the Quality Program Office (QPO) in SPEC headquarters will conduct Quality Statistical \nSample (QSS) reviews. QSS reviews are critical to the success of the VITA/ TCE program and play an integral \npart in improving quality and consistent performance of sites. The review process validates accuracy of returns \nand measures adherence to all Quality Site Requirements (QSR) and Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC). \nQSS reviews provide opportunities to identify and correct problem areas and/or share best practices.\nSPEC works with Statistics of Income (SOI) office to decide the QSS review sample size before the start of the \nfiling season. SOI selects the sites for QSS reviews based on criteria set by SPEC to ensure a valid accuracy \nmeasure for the VITA/TCE program. QSS reviews are unannounced unless prior notification is required to \naccess the site and include a minimum of three return reviews and a site review. QSS reviewers conduct a \nthorough review of the siteâs processes and operations for adherence to the QSR. SPEC uses results from \nQSS reviews to determine VITA/ TCE accuracy rates.\nQSS Return Reviews: These reviews include building a redacted case file, which requires a copy of each \ntax return reviewed for verification of the data collected. QSS reviewers scan tax returns and documentation \ninto an encrypted folder, however other means include photocopying, emailing, or faxing the tax return and \ndocumentation. The QSS reviewer will randomly select a minimum of three tax returns and use Form 6729-\nR, QSS Return Review Sheet, to gather information about the accuracy of each federal tax return. A return \nis accurate when the tax law has been applied correctly with no errors found based on current tax law, the \ncompleted Form 13614-C, and taxpayerâs supporting documents. QSS reviewers often ask questions to clarify \nor verify entries on the tax return and Form 13614-C.\n90 CHAPTER 11: Types of Site Reviews\nQSS Site Reviews: QSS reviewers will use Form 6729, QSS Site Review Sheet, to gather information about \nsite operations and adherence to the QSR and VSC. QSS reviewers will observe the siteâs operations and will \nrequest time toward the end of the review to ask questions to clarify your site processes and procedures. \nPost Review Discussion: After completing the return and site reviews, QSS reviewers provide preliminary \nfeedback to the coordinator. QSS reviewers discuss both the site and return review findings.\nFollow-up and Corrective Actions: After the review, QSS reviewers email follow-up and corrective actions for \nthe SPEC territory office to respond to, if needed. QSS reviewers email the Final Results Email to the SPEC \nterritory office with feedback, completed Form 6729 and completed Forms 6729-R for each return reviewed.\nThe SPEC territory office  provides a copy ofthe Final Results Email to the SPEC territory office email with the \ncompleted Form 6729 and completed Forms 6729-R to the partner or coordinator.\nFor detailed information on QSS review results for the most recent filing season, see Publication 5347, Fact \nSheet: Quality Statistical Sample Reviews for SPEC Partners and Employees. Download Publication 5347 \nfrom Site Coordinator Corner on IRS.gov.\nThe QSS Review Process\nOnce the QSS reviewer arrives at the site, they will:\nâ¢\t\nRequest to speak to the coordinator or person managing the site, introduce themselves, provide IRS \nidentification, give a brief explanation of the QSS review process, offer Publication 4675, Request \nto Quality Review Your Federal Tax Return and request an explanation of the siteâs tax preparation \nprocess.\nâ¢\t\nRequest a place with access to an electrical outlet to conduct return reviews, preferably in a location to \nview all site operations.\nâ¢\t\nIdentify and select the first return to be reviewed.\nâ¢\t\nAsk the taxpayer for permission to quality review their return. QSS reviewers provide taxpayers with a \ncopy of Publication 4675 when asking for their consent. QSS reviewers ask taxpayers to remain at the \nsite until the review is complete.\nâ¢\t\nReview Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet to ensure it is properly completed. \nâ¢\t\nVerify taxpayer (and spouse if married filing jointly) identity with a photo ID.\nâ¢\t\nVerify taxpayer identification numbers (SSN or ITIN) of all persons listed on the return.\nâ¢\t\nVerify all return entries for each return, including personal and financial information by reviewing:\n\t\nâ\nA printed copy of the return with supporting forms and schedules attached\n\t\nâ\nAll source documents required for return preparation including photo identification, original or copy \nof Social Security card(s), Forms W-2, 1099, 1095, receipts, etc.\n\t\nâ\nBank deposit information\nâ¢\t\nScan Form 13614-C, the return and supporting documents. Photocopy or fax if unable to scan. \nâ¢\t\nComplete a return review using Form 6729-R, QSS Return Review Sheet for each return reviewed.\nâ¢\t\nRemove all personally identifiable information (PII) including Social Security numbers, names, address, \netc. QSS reviewers redact all PII from the scanned documents for the case file.\nâ¢\t\nRepeat the process for additional return reviews.\nâ¢\t\nComplete a site review using Form 6729, QSS Site Review Sheet based on observations and site \ncoordinator responses.\nâ¢\t\nProvide verbal feedback of their findings after completing the reviews and addressing any questions \nand concerns.\nQSS reviewers email final results within 10 business days of the completed QSS reviews. The SPEC territory \noffice forwards the results of the QSS review to the partner and coordinator.\nQSS Site Reviews: QSS reviewers will use Form 6729, QSS Site Review Sheet, to gather information about \nsite operations and adherence to the VSC and QSR. QSS reviewers will observe the siteâs operations and will \nrequest time toward the end of the review to ask questions to clarify your site processes and procedures.",

SPEC considers the use of these forms optional.\nSPEC Financial Reviews\nFinancial reviews are conducted by the Grant Program Office (GPO) on VITA/TCE grant partners. The primary \npurpose of the financial review is to ensure that grant funds are spent in accordance with grant terms and \nconditions, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars, federal laws, and statutes. Financial reviewers \nalso consider whether the grantee sub-awards a portion of their grant. GPO can also recommend recipients \nfor a review depending on monitoring activities. These reviews are conducted throughout the calendar year. \nReviewers will contact your partner to schedule the review. They will give your partner feedback after the \nreview in a written report. This gives the partner an opportunity to respond to any findings.\nTreasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) Shopping Reviews\nTIGTA performs reviews to ensure return accuracy. This process uses pre-designed scenarios generally to test \nnew tax law or new procedures. TIGTA shopping results are not statistically valid and cannot be projected to \nthe entire population of returns prepared at the volunteer sites. TIGTA reviewers arrive unannounced at VITA/\nTCE sites without notifying SPEC nor its partners prior to a visit.\nDuring the filing season, a cadre of TIGTA Auditors conduct TIGTA shopping reviews. TIGTA provides the \nshoppers with a pre-defined taxpayer scenario and the TIGTA shoppers assume the role of the taxpayer \nrequesting services from a VITA or TCE site. TIGTA shoppers remain anonymous until the VITA/TCE sites \ncompletes the tax return and the return goes through the siteâs quality review process.\nOnce a TIGTA shopper identifies themself, the VITA/TCE site deletes the tax return by deactivating it from the \ntax preparation software to avoid the transmission of a fictitious return. If TIGTA shoppers visit your site, SPEC \nasks that you notify your SPEC RM and provide feedback regarding your experience with the review or send \nan email to partner@irs.gov.\nCivil Rights Unit (CRU) Reviews\nThe Civil Rights Unit (CRU) visits volunteer sites operated by partners receiving federal assistance. The \npurpose of CRU visits is to validate compliance with civil rights rules and reasonable accommodations for \npersons with disabilities. CRU discusses the results of these visits with the partner and SPEC headquarters. \nFor more information on civil rights notification, refer to Publication 4053 (en-sp), Your Civil Rights are \nProtected (English and Spanish Version) Poster for IRS Assisted Programs (VITA/TCE/LITC).

SPEC often collaborates with other agencies in the IRS to distribute outreach materials and \nproducts that support tax education.\nThe IRS offers electronic communication materials to reach customers. Partners can use the information to \neducate customers, employees, and volunteers about any of the provided topics.\nSharing Details of Outreach Activities\nWhenever partners share outreach materials with taxpayers or publicize tax or financial education and asset \nbuilding (FEAB) events, SPEC asks that the partners provide their RM at the local SPEC territory office with \nthe details, so they have an awareness of your efforts.\n98 CHAPTER 12: Partner and Coordinator Program Resources\nPartner Role\nPartners will receive email messages from the local SPEC territory office that contain IRS outreach messages. \nThese emails ask for assistance in delivering the messages to partnersâ clients. When partners receive these \nemails, SPEC asks them to review the materials to see how the outreach message fits their communication \nchannels.\nSPEC will ensure that partners have the current products and tools available for their clients. Partners will \nreceive tools such as:\nâ¢\t\nKey messages\nâ¢\t\nLinks to videos\nâ¢\t\nSocial media messages\nâ¢\t\nDirect links to other key products\nSubscribe to IRS Outreach Connection\nThe IRS Outreach Connection is an online center with content and products for use in your communication \nvehicles.

Partners can submit \nsuggestions for topics to partner@irs.gov.\nPartner Template Toolkit\nSome partners market their VITA/TCE sites and outreach using material that includes the IRS logo. If an IRS \npartner wishes to include the IRS logo on their VITA/TCE marketing materials, they must submit the request to \ntheir local SPEC territory office for review and approval.\nTo assist in making this process simpler, there are ready-made templates with the IRS logo for use by partners. \nPartners may choose to use these templates and not worry about the expense and time involved in creating \nand designing their own products. Using the IRS templates will save time with faster approval and provide \nconsistent messaging with a professional look that includes the IRS logo.\nUsing the templates is optional. Partners may still create and submit their own material and request use of the \nIRS logo, but the approval process will take more time.\nIRS Logo Approval Process\nPartners using their own product design:\nA partner who wishes to use their own product design and wants to include the IRS logo must submit the \nproduct(s) through their local SPEC territory office for review and approval. This approval process can take up \nto three weeks.\nPartners using the partner template toolkit:\nPublication 5176,  VITA/TCE Templates Thumbnail, includes thumbnail pictures of each available ready-made \ntemplate, instructions on how to get the templates and guidelines on how to use them.\nPartners that want to take advantage of using the templates may contact their local SPEC territory office.
