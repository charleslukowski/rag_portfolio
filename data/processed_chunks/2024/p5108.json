    "text": "Section 1: General Information \nDescription of the Sample \nand Limitations of the Data \nhis section describes the sample design, sample se- \nlection, data capture, data cleaning, and data comple-\ntion processes for the SOI Tax Year (TY) 2021 \nBackground \nFrom TY 1916 through TY 1950, SOI extracted data from \neach corporate income tax return filed. Beginning with TY \n1951, however, SOI introduced stratified probability \nsampling. Since that time, the sample size has generally \ndecreased while the corporate tax return population has in- \ncreased. For example, for TY 1951, the sample accounted for \n41.5% percent of the entire population, or 285,000 of the \n687,000 total returns filed. For TY 2021, the sample \naccounted for about 1.98% percent of the total population \nof just under 7.5 million returns. This population count \ndiffers \nfrom \nthe \nestimated population count cited \nelsewhere in this publication because the sampling frame \nincludes out-of-scope and duplicate returns. \nFor TY 1951, SOI stratified the sample by size of total \nassets and industry. However, from TY 1952 through TY 1967, \nSOI stratified the sample by a measure of size only. The size \nwas measured by either business volume (TY 1953– TY 1958) \nor total assets (TY 1952 and TY 1959– TY1967). Since TY \n1968, SOI has stratified returns by both total assets and, for \nForms 1120 and 1120-S, a measure of income [1]. \nTarget Population \nThe target population consists of all returns of active cor- \nporations organized for profit that are required to file one of \nthe 1120 forms included in this study. \nSurvey Population \nThe survey population includes corporate tax returns filed \nusing one of the 1120 forms selected for the study and posted \nto the IRS Business Master File (BMF). Excluded are amended \nreturns and returns for which the tax liabilities changed be- \ncause of a tax audit. Figure E gives the number of corporate \nreturns by form type that were subject to sampling during TY \n2018 through 2021, as well as the resulting sample sizes. \nSample Design \nThe current design is a probability sample stratified by \nform type and either by 1) size of total assets alone or 2) size \nof total assets and a measure of income. Form 1120 returns are \nstratified by size of total assets and size of “proceeds,” which \nFigure E.

It also presents the techniques \nused to produce estimates of the total number of active \ncorporations and associated variables as well as an assessment \nof the data limitations, including sampling and nonsampling \nerrors. \n2021 Corporation Returns Line Item Estimates \nDescription of the Sample and Limitations of the Data \nis the measure of income for this form. Size of proceeds is \ndefined as the larger of the absolute value of net income (or \ndeficit) or the absolute value of “cash flow,” which is the sum of \nnet income, several depreciation amounts, and depletion. Form \n1120-S is stratified by size of total assets and size of ordinary \nincome. SOI stratified all other 1120 forms (1120-L, 1120-PC, \n1120-RIC, 1120-REIT, and 1120-F) by size of total assets only. \nSOI began the design process with projected population \ntotals derived from IRS administrative workload estimates, \nadjusted using the distribution by population strata from \nprevious survey years. Using projected population totals by \nsample strata, SOI carried out an optimal allocation based on \nstrata standard errors to assign sample sizes to each stratum such \nthat the overall targeted sample size was 129,000 returns for TY \n2021, significantly larger than the TY 2020 target. Mathematical \nstatisticians selected a Bernoulli sample independently from \neach stratum, with sampling rates ranging from 0.25 percent to \n100 percent. The total realized sample for 2021, including \ninactive and noneligible corporations, is 146,732 returns. \nSample Selection \nThe IRS Kansas City and Ogden Submission Processing \nCenters initially process all corporate returns to determine tax \nliability before transmitting the data daily to the BMF. After \nerror correction, these returns are said to “post” to the BMF, \nwhich serves as the SOI sampling frame. SOI selects the sample \non a weekly basis. \nSample selection for TY 2021 occurred over a 24-month \nperiod, from July 2021 through June 2023. SOI requires a 24-\nmonth sampling period for two reasons. First, nearly 5.8 \npercent of all corporations use non-calendar year accounting \nperiods. To capture these returns, the TY 2021 statistics include \nall corporations filing returns with accounting periods ending \nbetween July 2021 and June 2022. Second, many corporations, \nincluding some of the largest corporations, request filing \nextensions, which generally extend the filing deadline by 6 \nmonths. This combination of non-calendar year accounting \nperiods and filing extensions means that the last TY 2021 \nreturns the IRS received had accounting periods ending in June \n2022, and therefore had to be filed by September 2022. \nHowever, taking into account the filing extensions, these \nreturns could have been filed as late as April 2023 and still be \nconsidered timely. To account for the normal processing time, \nthe sample selection process remained open for the TY 2021 \nstudy until the end of June 2023. In addition, SOI adjusted its \nprocesses because some significant returns became available \nfor SOI processing later as a result of COVID-19 related \nprocessing adjustments in the IRS Submission Processing \nCenters. \nEach tax return in the survey population is assigned to a \nstratum and subject to sampling. Each filing corporation has a \nunique Employer Identification Number (EIN). An integer \nfunction of the EIN, called the Transformed Taxpayer \nIdentification \nNumber \n(TTIN), \nis \ncomputed. \nThe \nnumber formed by the last four digits of the TTIN is \na pseudo-random number. A return for which this pseudo-\nrandom number is less than the sampling rate multiplied by \n10,000 is selected for the sample. \nThe algorithm for generating the TTIN does not change \nfrom year to year. Therefore, corporations selected for the \nsample in any given year may be selected the following year, \nproviding the corporation files a return using the same EIN \nand it falls into a stratum with the same or higher sampling \nrate. If the corporation falls into a stratum with a lower rate, \nthe probability of selection will be the ratio of the second-\nyear sampling rate to the first-year sampling rate. If the \ncorpora- tion files with a new EIN, the probability of \nselection will be independent from the prior-year selection \n[2]. \nData Capture \nData processing for SOI begins with information already \nextracted for IRS administrative purposes; over 100 items \navailable from the BMF system are checked and corrected as \nnecessary. SOI extracts some 2,500 additional data items from \nthe corporate tax returns during processing. This data- \ncapture process can take as little as 15 minutes for a small, \nsingle-entity corporation filing Form 1120, or up to several \nweeks for a large, consolidated corporation filing several hun- \ndred attachments and schedules with the return. The process \nis further complicated by several factors: \n●Over 2,500 separate data items may be extracted from any\ngiven tax return. This often requires constructing totals\nfrom various other items elsewhere on the return.\n●Each 1120 form type has a different layout with different\ntypes of schedules and attachments, making data extrac- \ntion less than uniform for the various forms.\n●There is no legal requirement for a corporation to meet its\ntax return filing requirements by filling in, line by line,\nthe entire U.S. tax return form. Therefore, many corporate\ntaxpayers report financial details using schedules of their\nown design or using commercial tax preparation software\npackages.\n●There is no single accepted method of corporate tax ac- \ncounting in the United States, but rather, several accepted\n“guidelines,” which can vary by geographic location. SOI\nstaff attempt to standardize these differences during data\nabstraction and editing.\n●Different companies may report the same data item,\nsuch as other current liabilities, on different lines of the\ntax form. SOI staff also attempt to standardize these\ndifferences.\nTo help staff overcome these complexities and differences\nin taxpayer reporting, for each tax year, SOI prepares de- \ntailed instructions for the editing units at the IRS Submission \nProcessing Centers. For TY 2021, these instructions covered \nstandard and straightforward procedures and instructions for \naddressing data exceptions. \n2\nDescription of the Sample and Limitations of the Data \n 2021 Corporation Returns Line Item Estimates \nData Cleaning \nSOI staff enter data directly into the database from the \ncorporate tax returns selected for the sample. In this context, \nthe term “editing” refers to the combined interactive processes \nof data extraction, consistency testing, and error resolution. \nSOI runs hundreds of tests to check for inconsistencies, includ- \ning the following: \n●Impossible conditions, such as incorrect tax data for a\nparticular form type;\n●Internal inconsistencies, such as items not adding to totals;\n●Questionable values, such as a bank with an unusually\nlarge amount reported for cost of goods sold and/or opera- \ntions; and\n●Improper sample class codes, such as when a return has\n$100 million in total assets, but was selected as though it\nhad $1 million because the last two digits of the total\nassets were keyed in as cents.\nData Completion \nIn addition to the tests mentioned above, SOI addresses \nmissing data items and identifies returns to be excluded from \nthe tabulations. The data completion process focuses on these \nissues. \nBeginning with the TY 2012 sample, the criteria for im- \nputing balance sheets for returns with incomplete balance \nsheets changed significantly. Now, only the largest returns \nwith incomplete balance sheets are subject to SOI’s balance \nsheet imputation procedure. As a result, the number of returns \nwith imputed balance sheets will be negligible, and SOI will \nperform imputation on an ad hoc basis only. \nSOI uses various methods to impute data for some cer- \ntainty returns unavailable for editing, depending on the infor- \nmation available at the time the return needs to be completed \nfor the sample. These corporations are identified from the pre- \nvious year’s sample using a combination of assets and receipts. \nAdditional corporations may be identified to ensure industry \ncoverage. SOI uses data filed electronically for those corporate \nreturns selected for the sample, but unavailable for statistical \nprocessing. For TY 2021 there were 22 returns that met these \ncriteria. For some returns not selected for the sample, if the \ncurrent tax return was not located and no other current tax data \nwere available, then SOI used data from the previous year’s \nreturn, with adjustments for tax law changes, if needed. \nThe data completion process also includes identifying \nreturns not eligible for the sample as the BMF may have du- \nplicate and other out-of-scope returns. These returns include \nthose filed by nonprofit corporations, returns having neither \ncurrent income nor deductions, and prior-year tax returns. \nAdditionally, amended or tentative returns, nonresident for- \neign corporations having no effectively connected income with \na trade or business located in the United States, fraudulent \nreturns, and returns filed by tax-exempt corporations are not \neligible for the sample. Figure F displays the number of inac- \ntive sampled returns excluded from the tabulations, as well as \nthe percentages of the total sample size they represent for TY \n2018 through TY 2021. \nFigure F.

Under the one-step process, \nSOI assigns a weight for the return, which is the reciprocal of \nthe realized sampling rate, adjusted for unavailable returns, \noutliers, weight trimming, and any other necessary adjust- \nments. SOI used these weights, referred to as the “national \nweights,” to produce the estimates published in this report for \nForms 1120-F, 1120-L, 1120-PC, 1120-RIC, and 1120-REIT, \nas well as Forms 1120 and 1120-S returns that were sampled \nwith certainty. \n3\n2021 Corporation Returns Line Item Estimates \nDescription of the Sample and Limitations of the Data \nThe two-step process is used to improve the estimates by \nindustry for returns filed on either Form 1120 or Form 1120-S \nthat are not selected in self-representing strata. The first \nstage of the two-step process is to assign an initial weight for \nthe return as described above. The second stage involves \npost-stratification by industry and sample selection class. SOI \nuses a bounded raking ratio estimation approach to determine \nthe final weights because certain post-stratification cells may \nhave small sample sizes [3]. SOI used these final weights to \nproduce the aggregated frequency and money amount \nestimates that are published in this report for these forms. \nData Limitations and Measures of Variability \nSOI uses several extensive quality review processes to \nimprove data quality. This starts at the sample selection stage \nwith weekly monitoring to ensure the proper number of returns \nis selected, especially in the certainty strata. These processes \ncontinue through the data collection, data cleaning, and data \ncompletion procedures with consistency testing. Part of the \nreview process includes extensive comparisons between the \nsample year (TY 2021) and prior-year (TY 2020) data. SOI \ndesigned each processing stage to ensure data integrity. \nSampling Error \nSince the TY 2021 estimates are based on a sample, they \nmay differ from population aggregates resulting from a com- \nplete census of all corporate income tax returns. The TY 2021 \nsample is one of many possible samples that could have been \nselected under the same sample design. Estimates derived \nfrom one possible sample could differ from those derived \nfrom another, and also from the population aggregates. The \ndeviation of a sample estimate from the average of all possible \nsimilarly selected samples is called the sampling error. \nThe standard error (SE), a measure of the average magni- \ntude of the sampling errors over all possible samples, can be \nestimated from the realized sample. The estimated standard \nerror is usually expressed as a percentage of the value being \nestimated. This is called the estimated coefficient of variation \n(CV) of the estimate, and it can be used to assess the reliabil- \nity of an estimate. The smaller the CV, the more reliable the\nestimate is deemed to be.\nSOI calculates the estimated coefficient of variation of  an \nestimate by dividing the estimated standard error by the esti- \nmate itself and taking the absolute value of this ratio. Table 1 \n(see Section 4) shows the estimated coefficients of variation \nby industrial groupings for the estimated number of returns \nas well as selected money amounts. \nThe estimated CV, CV(X), can be used to construct \nconfidence intervals for the estimate X. The estimated \nstandard error, which is required for the confidence interval, \nmust first be calculated. For example, the estimated number \nof companies in the manufacturing sector with net income and \nthe corresponding estimated CV can be found in Table 1 and \nused to calculate the estimated standard error: \nSE(X) = X • CV(X) \n= 138,234 x 4.07/100 \n= 5,626 \nA 95% percent confidence interval for the estimated \nnumber of returns in manufacturing is constructed as follows: \nX ± 2 • SE(X) = 138,234 ± (2 x 5,626) \n = 138,234 ± 11,252 \nThe interval estimate is 126,982 returns to 149,486 re- \nturns. This means that if all possible samples were selected \nunder the same general conditions and sample design, and if \nan estimate and its estimated standard error were calculated \nfrom each sample, then approximately 95 percent of the in- \ntervals from two standard errors below the estimate to two \nstandard errors above the estimate would include the average \nestimate derived from all possible samples. Thus, for a particu- \nlar sample, it can be said with 95-percent confidence that the \naverage of all possible samples is included in the constructed \ninterval. This average of the estimates derived from all pos- \nsible samples would be equal to or near the value obtained \nfrom a census. \nNonsampling Error \nIn addition to sampling error, nonsampling error can also \naffect the estimates. Nonsampling errors can be classified into \ntwo groups: random errors, whose effects may cancel out, and \nsystematic errors, whose effects tend to remain somewhat \nfixed and result in bias. \nNonsampling errors include coverage errors, nonresponse \nerrors, processing errors, or response errors. The inability to \nobtain information for all sampled returns, differing interpre- \ntations of tax concepts or taxpayer instructions, inability to \nprovide accurate information at the time of filing (data are col- \nlected before auditing), and inability to obtain all tax schedules \nand attachments may cause these errors. These errors may also \nbe caused by data recording or coding errors, data collecting \nor cleaning errors, estimation errors, and failure to represent \nall population units. \nCoverage Errors: Coverage errors in the SOI corporation \ndata can result from the difference between the time frame for \nsampling and the actual time needed for filing and processing \nthe returns. Since many of the largest corporations receive \nfiling-period extensions, they may file their returns after the \nclosing date for sample selection, as explained in the Sample \nSelection description, which appears earlier in this section. \nHowever, any of the largest returns found are added into the \nfile until the final file is produced. \n          Coverage problems within industrial groupings in the SOI \nCorporation study may result from the way some consolidated \nreturns are filed. The IRC permits a parent corporation to file \na single return, which includes the combined financial data of \nthe parent and its subsidiaries. These data are not separated \ninto the different industries, but are entered into the industry \nwith the\n4\nDescription of the Sample and Limitations of the Data \n 2021 Corporation Returns Line Item Estimates \nlargest receipts. Thus, there is undercoverage of financial \ndata within certain industries and overcoverage in others. \nCoverage problems within industries present a limitation on \nany analysis of the sample results. \nNonresponse Errors: There are two types of nonresponse \nerrors: unit and item. Unit nonresponse occurs when a sampled \nreturn is unavailable for SOI processing. For example, other \nareas of the IRS may have the return at the time it is needed \nfor statistical processing. These returns are termed “unavail- \nable returns.” \nItem nonresponse occurs when certain items are unavail- \nable for a return selected for SOI processing, even if the return \nitself is available. An example of item nonresponse would be \nitems missing from the balance sheet, even though other items \nhave been reported. \nProcessing Errors: Errors in recording, coding, or pro- \ncessing the data can cause a return to be sampled in the wrong \nsampling class. This type of error is called a misstratification \nerror. One example of how a return might be misstratified is \nthe following: a corporation files a return with total assets of \n$100,000,023 and net income of $5,000. A processing error \ncauses the last two digits of the total assets to be keyed in as \ncents, so that the return is classified according to total assets of \n$1,000,000.23 and net income of $5,000.00. The return would \nbe misstratified according to the incorrect value of the total \nassets stratifier. To adjust for misstratification errors, only   \nreturns selected in a noncertainty stratum that really  bel- \nonged in a certainty stratum were moved to this certainty \nstratum. \nResponse Errors: Response errors are due to data being \ncaptured before audit. Some purely arithmetical errors made \nby the taxpayer are corrected during the data capture and \ncleaning processes. Because of time constraints, SOI does not \nincorporate adjustments to a return during audit into the file. \nReferences \n[1] Jones, H. W., and McMahon, P. B.

As such, the data \ncontained here are from a sample that could be one of a number of possible samples of corporate tax returns. Because each \nsample would contain different returns, estimates constructed from each sample would vary. The sample estimate, along \nwith the estimated standard error, allows the computation of confidence intervals indicating that the estimate is contained \nwithin the interval with the prescribed confidence. Below are the computed 95% confidence intervals for selected variable \ncounts that are shared among one or more Form 1120 return types, along with the associated Coefficient of Variation \n(CV). The variables selected are detailed in the 2021 SOI Corporate Income Tax Return Complete Report (Publication 16).\nTable 1.  95% Confidence Intervals for Estimates of Selected Variables \nNotes on Data Estimates \nEstimates marked with an asterisk (*) preceding the data are based on a small number of sampled returns and should be \nused with caution.  A dash (-) or zero shown in place of an estimate indicates that there were no returns having that \ncharacteristic, or the characteristic was so rare that it did not appear on any sampled returns.  The symbol (d) indicates \nthat this value (and the associated money amount) was suppressed to avoid disclosure of information for specific \ncorporations.  Detail may not add to total due to taxpayer reporting, rounding, and the impact of adjustments or other \nitems not shown separately. \nSome attachments to Form 1120 series returns were excluded because the quantities represented in the sample were \ninsufficient for this publication.

For the latest information about developments \nrelated to Form 8586 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted \nafter they were published, go to www.irs.gov/Form8586.\nPurpose of Form\nUse Form 8586 to claim the low-income housing credit. This general \nbusiness credit is allowed for each new qualified low-income \nbuilding placed in service after 1986. Generally, it is taken over a \n10-year credit period.\nTaxpayers, other than partnerships, S corporations, estates, or\ntrusts, whose only source of this credit is from those pass-through \nentities, are not required to complete or file this form. Instead, they \ncan report this credit directly on Form 3800.\nQualified Low-Income Housing Project\nThe credit cannot exceed the amount allocated to the building. See \nsection 42(h)(1) for details.\nThe low-income housing credit can only be claimed for residential \nrental buildings in low-income housing projects that meet one of the \nminimum set-aside tests. For details, see the instructions for Form \n8609, Part II, line 10c.\nExcept for buildings financed with certain tax-exempt bonds, you \nmay not take a low-income housing credit on a building if it has not \nreceived an allocation from the housing credit agency. No allocation \nis needed when 50% or more of the aggregate basis of the building \nand the land on which the building is located is financed with \ncertain tax-exempt bonds. The owner must still get a Form 8609 \nfrom the appropriate housing credit agency (with the applicable \nitems completed, including an assigned BIN). “Land on which the \nbuilding is located” includes only land that is functionally related \nand subordinate to the qualified low-income building. (See \nRegulations sections 1.103-8(a)(3) and 1.103-8(b)(4)(iii).)\nRecapture of Credit\nThere is a 15-year compliance period during which the residential \nrental building must continue to meet certain requirements. If, as of \nthe close of any tax year in this period, there is a reduction in the \nqualified basis of the building from the previous year, you may have \nto recapture a part of the credit you have taken. Similarly, you may \nhave to recapture part of the credits taken in previous years upon \ncertain dispositions of the building or interests therein, unless you \nfollow the procedures to prevent recapture.

For the latest information about developments \nrelated to Form 8586 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted \nafter they were published, go to www.irs.gov/Form8586.\nPurpose of Form\nUse Form 8586 to claim the low-income housing credit. This general \nbusiness credit is allowed for each new qualified low-income \nbuilding placed in service after 1986. Generally, it is taken over a \n10-year credit period.\nTaxpayers, other than partnerships, S corporations, estates, or\ntrusts, whose only source of this credit is from those pass-through \nentities, are not required to complete or file this form. Instead, they \ncan report this credit directly on Form 3800.\nQualified Low-Income Housing Project\nThe credit cannot exceed the amount allocated to the building. See \nsection 42(h)(1) for details.\nThe low-income housing credit can only be claimed for residential \nrental buildings in low-income housing projects that meet one of the \nminimum set-aside tests. For details, see the instructions for Form \n8609, Part II, line 10c.\nExcept for buildings financed with certain tax-exempt bonds, you \nmay not take a low-income housing credit on a building if it has not \nreceived an allocation from the housing credit agency. No allocation \nis needed when 50% or more of the aggregate basis of the building \nand the land on which the building is located is financed with \ncertain tax-exempt bonds. The owner must still get a Form 8609 \nfrom the appropriate housing credit agency (with the applicable \nitems completed, including an assigned BIN). “Land on which the \nbuilding is located” includes only land that is functionally related \nand subordinate to the qualified low-income building. (See \nRegulations sections 1.103-8(a)(3) and 1.103-8(b)(4)(iii).)\nRecapture of Credit\nThere is a 15-year compliance period during which the residential \nrental building must continue to meet certain requirements. If, as of \nthe close of any tax year in this period, there is a reduction in the \nqualified basis of the building from the previous year, you may have \nto recapture a part of the credit you have taken. Similarly, you may \nhave to recapture part of the credits taken in previous years upon \ncertain dispositions of the building or interests therein, unless you \nfollow the procedures to prevent recapture. See Recapture and \nbuilding dispositions in the Instructions for Form 8609-A, Annual \nStatement for Low-Income Housing Credit, for details. If you must \nrecapture credits, use Form 8611, Recapture of Low-Income \nHousing Credit. See section 42(j) for details.\nRecordkeeping\nKeep a copy of this Form 8586 together with all Forms 8609, Forms \n8609-A, and Forms 8611 for 3 years after the 15-year compliance \nperiod ends.\nSpecific Instructions\nLine 2. A decrease in qualified basis will result in recapture if the \nqualified basis at the close of the tax year is less than the qualified \nbasis at the close of the first year of the credit period.\nIf the reduction in qualified basis at the close of the tax year also \nresults in a violation of the minimum set-aside requirement, then no \ncredit is allowable for the year.\nLine 3. The credit for the year is figured on Form 8609-A for each \nbuilding. Attach a copy of each Form 8609-A you completed for the \ntax year to Form 8586. Enter on line 3 the total credit for attached \nForm(s) 8609-A.\nLine 6. Estates or trusts. Allocate the low-income housing credit \non line 5 between the estate or trust and the beneficiaries in the \nsame proportion as income was allocated and enter the \nbeneficiaries’ share on line 6.\nIf the estate or trust is subject to the passive activity rules, include \non line 4 any low-income housing credits from passive activities \ndisallowed for prior years and carried forward to this year. Complete \nForm 8582-CR, Passive Activity Credit Limitations, to determine the \nallowed credit that must be allocated between the estate or trust and \nthe beneficiaries.

Policyholders must also indicate \nwhether a valid consent has been \nreceived from each covered employee, \nand the number of covered employees \nfor which a valid consent has not been \nreceived.\nFor more information, see sections \n101(j) and 6039I, and Notice 2009-48, \n2009-24 I.R.B. 1085, available at     \nwww.irs.gov/irb/2009-24_IRB/ar11.html.\nDefinitions \nEmployer-owned life insurance  \ncontract. For purposes of Form 8925,  \nan insurance contract is an employer-\nowned life insurance contract if it is \nowned by a policyholder as defined \nbelow, and covers the life of the \npolicyholder’s employee(s) on the date \nthe life insurance contract is issued. If \nyou have master contracts, see section \n101(j)(3) for additional  information. \nPolicyholder. For purposes of Form \n8925 and these instructions, a \npolicyholder is an “applicable          \npolicyholder” as defined in section      \n101(j)(3)(B). Generally, a policyholder is \nthe person who owns the employer-\nowned life insurance contract, and who \nis (a) engaged in a trade or business that \nemploys the person insured under the \nemployer-owned life insurance contract \nand (b) the direct or indirect beneficiary \nof the employer-owned life insurance \ncontract.\nRelated person. A related person is  \nconsidered a policyholder if that person \nis (a) related to the policyholder (defined \nearlier) under sections 267(b) or 707(b)\n(1), or (b) engaged in a trade or business \nunder common control with the \npolicyholder. See sections 52(a) and (b). \nEmployee. Employee includes an  \nofficer, director, or highly compensated \nemployee under section 414(q). \nInsured. An individual must be a U.S.  \ncitizen or resident to be considered  \ninsured under an employer-owned life  \ninsurance contract. Both individuals  \ncovered by a contract covering the joint \nlives of two individuals are considered \ninsured. \nNotice and consent requirements. To \nqualify as an employer-owned life  \ninsurance contract, the policyholder  \nmust meet the notice and consent  \nrequirements listed below before the  \nissuance of the contract. \n1. Provide written notification to the\nemployee stating the policyholder  \nintends to insure the employee’s life and \nthe maximum face amount for which the \nemployee could be insured at the time \nthe contract was issued.     \nThe written notification must include a \ndisclosure of the face amount of life \ninsurance, either in dollars or as a \nmultiple of salary, that the policyholder \nreasonably expects to purchase with \nregard to the employee during the \ncourse of the employee’s tenure. \nAdditional notice and consent are \nrequired if the aggregate face amount of \nthe employer-owned life insurance \ncontracts with regard to an employee \nexceeds the amount of which the \nemployee was given notice and to which \nthe employee consented.

For purposes of Form \n8925 and these instructions, a \npolicyholder is an “applicable          \npolicyholder” as defined in section      \n101(j)(3)(B). Generally, a policyholder is \nthe person who owns the employer-\nowned life insurance contract, and who \nis (a) engaged in a trade or business that \nemploys the person insured under the \nemployer-owned life insurance contract \nand (b) the direct or indirect beneficiary \nof the employer-owned life insurance \ncontract.\nRelated person. A related person is  \nconsidered a policyholder if that person \nis (a) related to the policyholder (defined \nearlier) under sections 267(b) or 707(b)\n(1), or (b) engaged in a trade or business \nunder common control with the \npolicyholder.
