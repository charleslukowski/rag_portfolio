A Pension Equity Plan (PEP) is a DB plan which, \nrather than or in addition to expressing the accrued benefit as \na life annuity commencing at normal retirement age, defines \nbenefits for each employee as an amount equal to an \naccumulated percentage of final pay. Benefits are generally \ndescribed as a percentage of final pay with the percentage \ndetermined as the accumulation of percentage points or \nlump-sum credits received for each year of service. \nGenerally, the accumulated percentage points or lump-sum \ncredits are multiplied by final average or career average \ncompensation to determine the lump-sum amount.\nA cash balance plan is a DB plan which, rather than or in \naddition to expressing the accrued benefit as a life annuity \ncommencing at normal retirement age, defines benefits for \neach employee in terms more common to a DC plan, that is, \nas a single-sum distribution amount equal to the employee’s \nhypothetical account balance. Benefits consist of an \naccumulation of hypothetical allocation credits to an account \nplus hypothetical accumulated interest credits on that \naccount.\nLine 6b(2). If the plan’s normal retirement age is below 62, \nthe employer (or trustees in the case of a multi-employer \nplan) must submit a signed statement that this is a good faith \ndetermination of the typical retirement age for the industry in \nwhich the covered workforce is employed.
