Lines \n15a, 21, 22, 24a, 28, 29, 30, 37, and 38 are now reserved \nfor future use because the period of limitations for \ncorrecting these lines has generally expired for most \nemployers. Generally, you may correct overreported taxes \non a previously filed Form 943 if you file Form 943-X within \n3 years of the date Form 943 was filed or 2 years from the \ndate you paid the tax reported on Form 943, whichever is \nlater. You may correct underreported taxes on a previously \nfiled Form 943 if you file Form 943-X within 3 years of the \ndate the Form 943 was filed. We call each of these time \nframes a period of limitations. For purposes of the period \nof limitations, Form 943 for a calendar year is considered \nfiled on April 15 of the succeeding year if filed before that \ndate. For an example of the period of limitations, see Is \nThere a Deadline for Filing Form 943-X, later. Before using \nany line on Form 943-X, you must consider if the period of \nlimitations, as described above, is still open for the year \nthat you’re correcting.\nLines 21 and 22 were previously used to correct the \ndeferred amount of the employer and employee share of \nsocial security tax for 2020.

The period of limitations for making corrections to \nqualified wages paid in 2020 for the employee retention \ncredit and qualified health plan expenses allocable to \nthose wages generally expired for most employers on \nApril 15, 2024. The period of limitations for making \ncorrections to qualified wages paid in 2021 for the \nemployee retention credit and qualified health plan \nexpenses allocable to those wages generally expired for \nmost employers on April 15, 2025.

Generally, the \ncredit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as \nenacted under the Families First Coronavirus Response \nAct (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the \nCOVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after \nMarch 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit \nfor qualified sick and family leave wages under sections \n3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as \nenacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the \nARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before \nOctober 1, 2021, have expired. However, employers that \npay qualified sick and family leave wages in a later year for \nleave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, \n2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified sick and \nfamily leave wages paid in that year. Effective for tax \nperiods beginning after December 31, 2023, the lines \nused to claim the credit for qualified sick and family leave \nwages were removed from Form 943 because it would be \nextremely rare for an employer to pay wages after \nDecember 31, 2023, for qualified sick and family leave \ntaken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021. \nInstead, if you're eligible to claim the credit for qualified \nsick and family leave wages because you paid the wages \nafter December 31, 2023, for an earlier applicable leave \nperiod, file Form 943-X to claim the credit for qualified sick \nand family leave wages paid for the year that you paid the \nwages after you file Form 943. Filing a Form 943-X before \nfiling a Form 943 for the year may result in errors or delays \nin processing your Form 943-X.\nYou will also continue to use Form 943-X to make \ncorrections to the credit for qualified sick and family leave \nwages for earlier years if the period of limitations is still \nopen.

For tax years beginning \nCAUTION\n!\nTIP\nbefore January 1, 2023, a qualified small business may \nelect to claim up to $250,000 of its credit for increasing \nresearch activities as a payroll tax credit. The Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) increases the election \namount to $500,000 for tax years beginning after \nDecember 31, 2022. The payroll tax credit election must \nbe made on or before the due date of the originally filed \nincome tax return (including extensions). The portion of \nthe credit used against payroll taxes is allowed in the first \ncalendar quarter beginning after the date that the qualified \nsmall business filed its income tax return. The election \nand determination of the credit amount that will be used \nagainst the employer's payroll taxes are made on Form \n6765, Credit for Increasing Research Activities. The \namount from Form 6765 must then be reported on Form \n8974, Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for \nIncreasing Research Activities.\nFor quarters beginning before January 1, 2023, the \npayroll tax credit can be used only against the employer \nshare of social security tax for the quarter and any \nremaining credit is carried forward to the next quarter. \nStarting in the first quarter of 2023, the payroll tax credit is \nfirst used to reduce the employer share of social security \ntax up to $250,000 per quarter and any remaining credit \nreduces the employer share of Medicare tax for the \nquarter. Any remaining credit, after reducing the employer \nshare of social security tax and the employer share of \nMedicare tax, is then carried forward to the next quarter. \nForm 8974 is used to determine the amount of the credit \nthat can be used in the current quarter. Corrections to this \ncredit are made on Form 943-X, line 13. If you make a \ncorrection to Form 943-X, line 13, you must attach a \ncorrected Form 8974. For more information, see the \nInstructions for Form 8974 and go to IRS.gov/\nResearchPayrollTC.\nCredit for COBRA premium assistance payments is \nlimited to periods of coverage beginning on or after \nApril 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning \non or before September 30, 2021.

This \nCOBRA premium assistance was available for periods of \ncoverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through \nperiods of coverage beginning on or before September \n30, 2021. A premium payee was entitled to the COBRA \npremium assistance credit at the time an eligible individual \nelects coverage. Therefore, other than in rare \ncircumstances, due to the COBRA notice and election \nperiod requirements (generally, employers have 60 days \nto provide notice and assistance eligible individuals have \n60 days to elect coverage), January 2022 was generally \nthe end of the period in which an assistance eligible \nindividual would have elected coverage. Under some rare \ncircumstances, it may be possible for a premium payee to \nbecome entitled to the COBRA premium assistance credit \nafter January 2022. In these rare instances, the credit is \nstill claimed on Form 943 filed for 2022 and an \nadjustment, if needed, can be made on Form 943-X for \n2022. Employers eligible to claim the COBRA premium \n2\nInstructions for Form 943-X (Rev. 4-2025)\nassistance credit after 2022 must file Form 943-X to claim \nthe credit.\nFor more information on COBRA premium assistance \npayments and the credit, see Notice 2021‐31, 2021‐23 \nI.R.B. 1173, available at IRS.gov/irb/\n2021-23_IRB#NOT-2021-31; and Notice 2021-46, \n2021-33 I.R.B. 303, available at IRS.gov/irb/\n2021-33_IRB#NOT-2021-46.\nCorrections to amounts reported on Form 943, lines \n12e, 12f, and 14g, for the COBRA premium assistance \ncredit are reported on Form 943-X, lines 15c, 15d, and \n24c, respectively.\nForms in Spanish. Many forms and instructions \ndiscussed in these instructions have Spanish-language \nversions available for employers and employees. Some \nexamples include Form 941 (sp), Form 943(sp), Form \nSS-4 (sp), Form W-4 (sp), and Form W-9 (sp). Although \nthese instructions don't reference Spanish-language \nforms and instructions in each instance that one is \navailable, you can see Pub. 15 (sp) or go to IRS.gov/\nSpanishForms to determine if a Spanish-language version \nis available.\nPayroll tax credit for certain tax-exempt organiza-\ntions affected by qualified disasters. Section 303(d) of \nthe Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 \nallows for a payroll tax credit for certain tax-exempt \norganizations affected by certain qualified disasters not \nrelated to COVID-19. This credit is claimed on Form \n5884-D. If applicable to the year that you're correcting, \nyou'll enter the credit claimed on Form 5884-D on \nWorksheet 1 to figure your credit for qualified sick and \nfamily leave wages for leave taken before April 1, 2021. \nFor more information about this credit, go to IRS.gov/\nForm5884D.\nEmployee consents to support a claim for refund. \nRev. Proc. 2017-28, 2017-14 I.R.B. 1061, available at \nIRS.gov/irb/2017-14_IRB#RP-2017-28, provides \nguidance to employers on the requirements for employee \nconsents used by an employer to support a claim for \nrefund of overcollected social security tax and Medicare \ntax. The revenue procedure clarifies the basic \nrequirements for both a request for employee consent and \nfor the employee consent, and permits a consent to be \nrequested, furnished, and retained in an electronic format \nas an alternative to a paper format. The revenue \nprocedure also contains guidance concerning when an \nemployer may claim a refund of only the employer share of \novercollected social security tax and Medicare tax. The \nrevenue procedure requires that any request for consent \ninclude an Additional Medicare Tax notice indicating that \nany claim on the employees’ behalf won’t include a claim \nfor overpaid Additional Medicare Tax.\nCorrecting federal income tax withheld.

For \nexample, you can’t correct federal income tax withheld in \na prior year because you used the wrong income tax \nwithholding table or you didn’t treat a payment correctly as \ntaxable or nontaxable. Similarly, if you paid federal income \ntax in a prior year on behalf of your employee rather than \ndeducting it from the employee’s pay (which resulted in \nadditional wages subject to tax), and in a subsequent year \nyou determine that you incorrectly calculated the amount \nof tax, you can’t correct the federal income tax \nwithholding.

Pub. 51 has been \ndiscontinued, but you may still need to reference the Pub. \n51 that was applicable for the tax year that you're \ncorrecting.\nWhen Should You File Form 943-X?\nFile Form 943-X when you discover an error on a \npreviously filed Form 943.\nHowever, if your only errors on Form 943 relate to the \nnumber of employees (Form 943, line 1) or to federal tax \nliabilities reported on your Monthly Summary of Federal \nTax Liability on Form 943, line 17, or on Form 943-A, \nAgricultural Employer's Record of Federal Tax Liability, \ndon’t file Form 943-X. For more information about \ncorrecting federal tax liabilities reported on your Monthly \nSummary of Federal Tax Liability on Form 943, line 17, or \non Form 943-A, see the Form 943-A instructions.\nDue dates. The due date for filing Form 943-X depends \non when you discover an error and if you underreported or \noverreported tax. If you underreported tax, see \nUnderreported tax, later. For overreported tax amounts, \nyou may choose to either make an interest-free \nadjustment or file a claim for refund or abatement. If you’re \ncorrecting overreported tax amounts, see Overreported \ntax—Adjustment process and Overreported tax—Claim \nprocess, later.\nIf any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal \nholiday, you may file Form 943-X on the next business day. \nIf we receive Form 943-X after the due date, we will treat \nForm 943-X as filed on time if the envelope containing \nForm 943-X is properly addressed, contains sufficient \npostage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service \n(USPS) on or before the due date, or sent by an \nIRS-designated private delivery service (PDS) on or \nbefore the due date. If you don’t follow these guidelines, \nwe will consider Form 943-X filed when it is actually \nreceived. See Pub. 15 for more information on legal \nCAUTION\n!\nTIP\nholidays. For more information about PDSs, see Where \nShould You File Form 943-X, later.\nUnderreported tax. If you’re correcting underreported \ntax, you must file Form 943-X by the due date of the return \nfor the return period in which you discovered the error \n(January 31 of the following year) and pay the amount you \nowe by the time you file. Doing so will generally ensure \nthat your correction is interest free and not subject to \nfailure-to-pay (FTP) or failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalties. \nSee What About Penalties and Interest, later. For details \non how to make a payment, see the instructions for \nline 25, later.\nIf Form 943-X is filed late (after the due date of the \nreturn for the return period in which you discovered the \nerror), you must attach an amended Form 943-A to Form \n943-X. Otherwise, the IRS may assess an “averaged” FTD \npenalty. See “Averaged” FTD penalty in section 11 of Pub. \n15 for more information about “averaged” FTD penalties. \nThe total tax reported on Form 943-A, line M, must match \nthe corrected tax (Form 943, line 13, combined with any \ncorrection reported on Form 943-X, line 20) for the year, \nless any previous abatements and interest-free tax \nassessments.\nExample—You owe tax. On February 14, 2025, you \ndiscovered that you underreported $1,000 of social \nsecurity and Medicare wages on your 2024 Form 943. File \nForm 943-X and pay the amount you owe by February 2, \n2026 (January 31, 2026, is a Saturday), because you \ndiscovered the error in 2025 and February 2, 2026, is the \ndue date for that year. If you file Form 943-X before \nFebruary 2, 2026, pay the amount you owe by the time \nyou file.\nForm 943-X can’t be used to correct \nunderreported amounts of Additional Medicare \nTax unless the amounts were withheld from \nemployee wages.\nOverreported tax—Adjustment process. If you \noverreported tax and choose to apply the credit to Form \n943, file an adjusted return on Form 943-X soon after you \ndiscover the error but more than 90 days before the period \nof limitations on the credit or refund for Form 943 expires. \nSee Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 943-X, later.\nForm 943-X can’t be used to correct overreported \namounts of Additional Medicare Tax unless the \namounts weren’t withheld from employee wages.\nExample—You want your credit applied to Form \n943. You filed your 2024 Form 943 on January 31, 2025, \nand payments were timely made. On May 6, 2025, you \ndiscover that you overreported tax on your 2024 Form \n943. You file Form 943-X on June 6, 2025, and check the \nbox on line 1 to indicate you want to use the adjustment \nprocess. The IRS treats your credit as a tax deposit made \non January 1, 2025. When you file your 2025 Form 943, \ninclude the amount from Form 943-X, line 25, on the “Total \ndeposits” line of your 2025 Form 943.\nOverreported tax—Claim process. If you overreported \ntax on Form 943, you may choose to file a claim for refund \nor abatement on Form 943-X any time before the period of \nlimitations on the credit or refund expires. If you also need \nCAUTION\n!\nCAUTION\n!\nInstructions for Form 943-X (Rev. 4-2025)\n5\nto correct any underreported tax amounts, you must file \nanother Form 943-X reporting only corrections to the \nunderreported tax amounts. See Is There a Deadline for \nFiling Form 943-X, later.\nYou may not file a refund claim to correct federal \nincome tax or Additional Medicare Tax actually \nwithheld from employees.\nIs There a Deadline for Filing Form \n943-X?\nGenerally, you may correct overreported taxes on a \npreviously filed Form 943 if you file Form 943-X within 3 \nyears of the date Form 943 was filed or 2 years from the \ndate you paid the tax reported on Form 943, whichever is \nlater. You may correct underreported taxes on a previously \nfiled Form 943 if you file Form 943-X within 3 years of the \ndate the Form 943 was filed. We call each of these time \nframes a period of limitations. For purposes of the period \nof limitations, Form 943 is considered filed on April 15 of \nthe succeeding calendar year if filed before that date.\nExample. You filed your 2023 Form 943 on January \n31, 2024, and payments were timely made. The IRS treats \nthe return as if it were filed on April 15, 2024. On January \n22, 2027, you discover that you overreported social \nsecurity and Medicare wages on that form by $350. To \ncorrect the error, you must file Form 943-X by April 15, \n2027, and use the claim process.\nIf you file Form 943-X to correct overreported tax \namounts in the last 90 days of a period of \nlimitations, you must use the claim process. You \ncan’t use the adjustment process. If you’re also correcting \nunderreported tax amounts, you must file another Form \n943-X to correct the underreported tax amounts using the \nadjustment process and pay any tax due.\nWhere Should You File Form 943-X?\nSend your completed Form 943-X to the address shown \nnext.\nIF you’re in . . .\nTHEN use this address . . .\nConnecticut, Delaware, District of \nColumbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, \nIndiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \nRhode Island, South Carolina, \nTennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West \nVirginia, Wisconsin\nDepartment of the Treasury\nInternal Revenue Service \nCincinnati, OH 45999-0008\nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, \nArkansas, California, Colorado, \nHawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, \nLouisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, \nMissouri, Montana, Nebraska, \nNevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, \nOklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, \nTexas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming\nDepartment of the Treasury\nInternal Revenue Service \nOgden, UT 84201-0008\nCAUTION\n!\nCAUTION\n!\nIF you’re in . . .\nTHEN use this address . . .\nNo legal residence or principal place \nof business in any state\nInternal Revenue Service \nP.O.

If you’re reporting several errors \nyou discovered at different times, enter the earliest date \nyou discovered an error here. Report any subsequent \ndates and related errors on line 41.\nMust You Make an Entry on Each Line?\nYou must provide all of the information requested at the \ntop of Form 943-X, page 1. You must check one box (but \nnot both) in Part 1. In Part 2, you must check the box on \n6\nInstructions for Form 943-X (Rev. 4-2025)\nline 3 and any applicable boxes on lines 4 and 5. In Part 3, \nif any line doesn't apply, leave it blank. Complete Parts 4 \nand 5 as instructed.\nHow Should You Report Negative Amounts?\nForm 943-X uses negative numbers to show reductions in \ntax (credits) and positive numbers to show additional tax \n(amounts you owe).\nWhen reporting a negative amount in columns 3 and 4, \nuse a minus sign instead of parentheses. For example, \nenter “-10.59” instead of “(10.59).” However, if you’re \ncompleting the return on your computer and your software \nonly allows you to use parentheses to report negative \namounts, you may use them.\nHow Should You Make Entries on Form 943-X?\nYou can help the IRS process Form 943-X timely and \naccurately if you follow these guidelines.\n• Type or print your entries.\n• Use Courier font (if possible) for all typed or \ncomputer-generated entries.\n• Omit dollar signs. You may use commas and decimal \npoints, if desired. Enter dollar amounts to the left of any \npreprinted decimal point and cents to the right of it.\n• Always show an amount for cents, even if it is zero. \nDon't round entries to whole dollars.\n• Complete all five pages and sign Form 943-X on \npage 5.\n• Staple multiple sheets in the upper-left corner.\nWhat About Penalties and Interest?\nGenerally, your correction of an underreported tax amount \nwon’t be subject to an FTP penalty, an FTD penalty, or \ninterest if you:\n• File on time (by the due date of Form 943 for the year in \nwhich you discover the error),\n• Pay the amount shown on line 25 by the time you file \nForm 943-X,\n• Enter the date you discovered the error, and\n• Explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to \nsupport the correction.\nNo correction will be eligible for interest-free treatment \nif any of the following apply.\n• The amounts underreported relate to an issue that was \nraised in an examination of a prior period.\n• You knowingly underreported your employment tax \nliability.\n• You received a notice and demand for payment.\n• You received a notice of determination under section \n7436.\nIf you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this \nreturn, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will \ndetermine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don’t \nattach an explanation when you file your return.\nOverview of the Process\nTo correct a previously filed Form 943, use Form 943-X to \nfile either an adjusted employment tax return or a claim for \nrefund or abatement. The adjustment process and the \nclaim process are outlined below.\nIf you underreported the tax. If you underreported \nthe tax on a previously filed Form 943, check the box on \nline 1 and pay any additional amount you owe by the \ntime you file Form 943-X. For details on how to make a \npayment, see the instructions for line 25, later.\nExample—You underreported employment taxes. \nOn June 18, 2025, you discovered an error that results in \nadditional tax on your 2024 Form 943. File Form 943-X by \nFebruary 2, 2026 (January 31, 2026, is a Saturday), and \npay the amount you owe by the time you file. See When \nShould You File Form 943-X, earlier. Don’t attach Form \n943-X to your 2025 Form 943.\nIf you overreported the tax. If you overreported the \ntax on a previously filed Form 943, choose one of the \nfollowing options.\n• Use the adjustment process. Check the box on line 1 to \napply any credit (negative amount) from line 25 to Form \n943 for the year during which you file Form 943-X.\n• Use the claim process. Check the box on line 2 to file a \nclaim on Form 943-X requesting a refund or abatement of \nthe amount shown on line 25.\nTo ensure that the IRS has enough time to \nprocess a credit for an overreporting tax \nadjustment in the year during which you file Form \n943-X, you’re encouraged to file Form 943-X correcting \nthe overreported tax amount in the first 11 months of a \nyear. For example, if you discover an overreported tax \namount in December, you may want to file Form 943-X \nduring the first 11 months of the next year. However, there \nmust be 90 days remaining on the period of limitations \nwhen you file Form 943-X. See the Caution under Is There \na Deadline for Filing Form 943-X, earlier. This should \nensure that the IRS will have enough time to process Form \n943-X so the credit will be posted before you file Form \n943, thus avoiding an erroneous balance due notice from \nthe IRS. See the example.\nExample—You want your overreported tax applied \nas a credit on Form 943. On December 19, 2025, you \ndiscover you overreported your tax on your 2024 Form \n943 and want to choose the adjustment process. To allow \nthe IRS enough time to process the credit, you file Form \n943-X on January 2, 2026, and take the credit on your \n2026 Form 943.\nSpecific Instructions:",

File \nForm 943-X to correct the wages subject to Additional \nMedicare Tax withholding for your 2024 Form 943, but you \nmay not correct the Additional Medicare Tax withheld \n(column 4) because the error involves a previous year and \nthe amount previously reported for the employee \nrepresents the actual amount withheld from the employee \nduring 2024.\nCombination of prior year administrative and nonad-\nministrative errors.

Federal Income Tax Withheld\nIf you’re correcting the federal income tax withheld from \nwages you reported on Form 943, line 8, enter the total \ncorrected amount in column 1.

Include any \nminus sign shown in column 3.\nGenerally, you may only correct administrative \nerrors to federal income tax withholding (that is, \nerrors in which the amount reported on Form 943, \nline 8, isn't the amount you actually withheld from an \nemployee's wages) and errors for which section 3509 \nrates apply. Only transposition or math errors involving the \ninaccurate reporting of the amount withheld are \n“administrative errors.” The administrative error \nadjustment corrects the amount reported on Form 943 to \nagree with the amount actually withheld from employees. \nSee section 2 of Pub. 15 for more information about \ncorrections during the calendar year and about \nadministrative errors. If section 3509 rates apply, see the \ninstructions for lines 16–19, later.\nYou can't file a Form 943-X to correct federal income \ntax withholding for prior years for nonadministrative errors. \nIn other words, you can't correct federal income tax \nactually withheld from an employee in a prior year if you \ndiscover that you didn't withhold the right amount. For \nexample, you can't correct federal income tax withheld in a \nprior year because you used the wrong income tax \nwithholding table or you didn't treat a payment correctly as \ntaxable or nontaxable. Similarly, if you paid federal income \ntax in a prior year on behalf of your employee rather than \ndeducting it from the employee's pay (which resulted in \nadditional wages subject to tax), and in a subsequent year \nyou determine that you incorrectly calculated the amount \nof tax, you can't correct the federal income tax \nwithholding.\nExample—Prior year nonadministrative error \n(failure to withhold federal income tax when \nrequired). You were required to withhold $400 of federal \nincome tax from an employee bonus that was paid in \nDecember of 2024 but you withheld nothing. You \ndiscovered the error on March 13, 2025. You can’t file \nForm 943-X to correct federal income tax withheld \nreported on your 2024 Form 943 because the error \ninvolves a previous year and the amount previously \nreported for the employee represents the actual amount \nwithheld from the employee during 2024.\nExample—Prior year administrative error \n(incorrectly reported amount of federal income tax \nactually withheld). You had three employees. In 2024, \nyou withheld $1,000 of federal income tax from Nathan \nBlack, $2,000 from Leah Green, and $6,000 from Becky \nLee. The total amount of federal income tax you withheld \nwas $9,000. You mistakenly reported $6,000 on line 8 of \nyour 2024 Form 943. You discovered the error on March \n13, 2025. This is an example of an administrative error \nthat may be corrected in a later calendar year because the \namount actually withheld from employees' wages isn’t the \namount reported on Form 943.
