Each year since, Congress has appropriated \nannual funding for the program. This funding allows the Stakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication \n(SPEC) organization within the IRS to provide grants to partner organizations to achieve the following program objectives:\n•  \u0007Enable the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program to extend services to underserved populations in \nhardest-to-reach areas, both urban and non-urban;\n•  \u0007Increase the capacity to file returns electronically;\n•  \u0007Heighten quality control;\n•  \u0007Enhance training of volunteers; and\n•  \u0007Improve significantly the accuracy rate of returns prepared at VITA sites.\nThe Taxpayer First Act made the VITA matching grant program permanent.\nThe VITA Grant program provides support to help organizations grow their existing programs. Although we may \noccasionally award an organization that has no experience with the VITA program, most recipients have extensive \nexperience. Interested applicants are encouraged to gain experience prior to applying for a grant. We found that experi­\nenced organizations are more likely to successfully deliver the objectives of the grant.\nBecause the VITA grant is in support of the VITA Program, grant recipients are required to follow existing guidance \ngoverning VITA site operations and to file all eligible returns electronically. The IRS provides the software for filing \nelectronically. General information about the program is included in this publication; however, the Publication 5683, \nVITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators, provides guidance on the operation of VITA sites and should \nbe consulted for current program requirements. Publication 5683 is available on IRS.gov.\nMeasures of Success\n•  \u0007Grant recipients are expected to achieve 100% of the return goal specified in their grant agreements.\n•  \u0007Grant recipients are expected to become more efficient each year with grant funds provided for their program. \n•  Grant recipients are expected to show incremental increases in return preparation each year.\nPublication Overview\nThis publication provides the general requirements for the VITA Program along with criteria and guidelines to help \ndetermine whether you are eligible to become a VITA grant recipient. Detailed instructions are included to assist in \npreparing your application. Carefully review the information contained in this publication before completing your \napplication. Incomplete, inaccurate, and late applications will not be considered for a grant. In addition, technical \nranking occurs simultaneously with Grant Program Office (GPO) evaluation. Any missing information identified by the \nGPO during its evaluation may not be considered by technical evaluators. It is the responsibility of the applicant to \nensure all information is submitted. Incomplete applications meeting basic eligibility will be scored based on the infor­\nmation available at time of review. Therefore, it is extremely important that the application is complete. Note: A glossary \nis included to assist in understanding terms used in this publication. \nThe period of performance is October 1 through September 30. IRS anticipates awarding grants by October 1. \nThe amount of each award is dependent on the applicant’s proposed program plan to reach its targeted populations \nand returns expected to be prepared in the program. The annual appropriation determines the total amount awarded. \nExpenses incurred in excess of the funds awarded are not reimbursable by the IRS. It is important to note that funding is \nsubject to congressional appropriation for the VITA Grant Program.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nVITA Grant Objectives\b\n2\nApplications must be submitted using Grants.gov. Interested applicants should register early and become familiar with \nGrants.gov requirements prior to the due date of the application. If you are awarded a grant, refer to Publication 4883, \nGrant Programs Resource Guide, for program expectations and reporting requirements. Publication 4883 is located on \nIRS.gov.\nE-mail is the preferred method of submitting questions regarding this program to the GPO.\n•  E-mail to Grant.Program.Office@irs.gov;\n•  Call at 470-639-2935\n•  Mail to Grant Program Office, 401 West Peachtree Street, NW, Stop 420-D, Atlanta, GA 30308\nVITA Grant Program Timeline\nApplication period\nMay 1 – May 31\nReview and evaluation\nJune 1 – September 30\nNotification of selection/non-selection\nOctober 1\nProject Period/Period of Performance\nOctober 1 – September 30\nPlease review the VITA Grant webpage (address available on inside cover of publication) for additional information \nabout the program. Interested applicants should also review Publication 5247, Volunteer Income Tax Assistance \n(VITA) Terms and Conditions, and Publication 4883, Grant Programs Resource Guide, for program requirements \nshould an award be offered.

The VITA Program offers free tax help for low to moderate \nincome individuals (defined by the earned income tax credit (EITC) threshold), persons with disabilities, persons \nwith limited English proficiency, Native Americans, individuals living in rural areas, members of the Armed Forces \nand their spouses, and the elderly. Trained VITA volunteers prepare basic income tax returns.\nThe growth and success of the VITA Program is attributed to a business model that leverages the resources \nof partners who are established in the community. The leveraging of partner resources began in 2000 with the \nreorganization of the IRS and the creation of the SPEC organization. In 2010, the IRS expanded services using \nfacilitated self-assistance. This offers an alternative for sites with limited volunteer resources by offering assis­\ntance to taxpayers who wish to prepare their own returns.\nThe IRS established certain requirements for participation to ensure consistent treatment of taxpayers and \naccurate return preparation. Additional information, along with any forms mentioned, are in Publication 5683, \nVITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators. This publication along with any forms covered in the \npublication are found at IRS.gov.\nEach VITA Grant recipient must operate within the established guidelines and requirements of the VITA Program.\nTax Return Preparation Methods\nThe VITA program expanded the tax return preparation methods to coincide with the advancement in technology. \nThe methods are:\nTraditional – This method involves face-to-face interaction with the taxpayer while screening, preparing, and \nquality reviewing the tax return. The taxpayer signs the returns before leaving the site. Generally, all activities are \nperformed in one visit.\nVirtual – This method uses two locations – an intake site and a preparation site – to assist the taxpayer. Taxpay­\ners provide their information at the intake site where volunteers secure tax related documents and confirm the \ntaxpayer’s identity. The information obtained at the intake site is provided to the preparation sites using mail, fax, \nscanned documents, or another approved method to facilitate the return preparation. The individual preparing \nor quality reviewing the return discusses the return with the taxpayer by phone or video. Signatures are obtained \nfrom the taxpayer by mail, fax scanned documents or another approved method before e-filing the returns. This \nmethod is often used to service remote locations; however, it can be used anywhere. It expands the opportunity \nto offer services to the disabled and elderly communities as well as those with transportation or other issues.\nFacilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) – This method provides taxpayers the opportunity to prepare and e-file their \nown return using a question based return preparation software. Taxpayers can choose from a variety of online \nsoftware options based on the taxpayer’s age, adjusted gross income, state of filing and other factors. Qualified \ntaxpayers receive free federal and state filing services. Certified volunteers are available to assist the taxpayers \nshould they have questions. Three FSA site types are in use:\n•  Fusion – These sites are generally located with traditional or virtual sites and offer the opportunity for taxpay­\ners interested in avoiding long lines, extended wait time, or visiting at another time, the opportunity to prepare \na return on their own. Operating from a physical site, these locations will be open certain hours/days.\n•  Stand-alone – These sites offer only taxpayer preparation (no traditional or virtual service provided) of re­\nturns and meet the need for taxpayers without ready access to a computer or Internet connection. Operat­\ning from a physical site, these locations will be open certain hours/days.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nVITA Program Overview and Requirements\b\n4\n•  Remote – These sites are internet-based. Partners place links on their website that allow taxpayers to access the \nonline software option and prepare their own return from anywhere at any time. Assistance of certified volunteers is \nlimited to the hours posted and contact between the volunteer and taxpayer may be by phone, web chat or email \ndepending on the option offered by the partner.\nVITA Grant recipients may count federal returns prepared using any of these three methods. However, grants will not be \nawarded to partners who offer only remote, internet-based Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) sites. Additional information \non the VITA program is available on IRS.gov on the Partner and Volunteer Resource Center web page.\nTax Preparation Software\nThe IRS provides tax preparation software for its tax preparation sites free of charge. VITA Grant funds cannot be used \nto purchase tax preparation software. Three products are available – desktop, online and self-preparation. Current users \nof desktop and new sites are strongly encouraged to consider the benefits of online software and use it when practical. \nAdvantages of this product include:\n•  No installation on individual computers – Program maintained on software provider’s server. Desktop users must \ninstall the software on their own computers.\n•   \u0007No updates required – Program is updated by software provider. Desktop users must download and update all \ncomputers. Failure to timely install updates result in the rejection of returns.\n•  No need to backup and restore returns to a central computer for transmission – Data is already on the software \nprovider’s server. Desktop users must backup and restore returns to their central computer designated for trans­\nmission since only one computer per site may transmit returns.\n•  Remote access to troubleshoot problems – The software provider has the ability to see what the user sees. \n•  Improved security\n ˚ No data stored on individual computers. Data is securely stored at the software provider’s secured facility. Desk­\ntop users store data on individual computers.\n ˚ The software provider uses software to reduce threat of hackers and detect intrusion attempts. Desktop users \ndon’t always have this additional layer of protection.\n•  Access from any computer with proper identification and broadband Internet – Product is immediately available for \nuse. Desktop product must be shipped and installed.\n•  Improved design – Easier access overall to tools used for return completion. Accessing some tools using the desk­\ntop product requires more steps.\nOnline Training\nAll volunteers must register and certify via Link & Learn Taxes (LLT) which is the web-based training program that links \nvolunteers to quality e-learning solutions. LLT is available on IRS.gov and can be found by using the key word search \nLink & Learn Taxes. This fun, interactive training teaches the basics to accurately prepare income tax returns for \nindividuals AND users can obtain volunteer certification along the way at their own pace! Students will make their way \nthrough lessons that include tax topics, case studies, and interview simulations. LLT uses pop-up windows to connect \nto forms, publications and other resource materials and presents tax law through a variety of adult learning strategies \nincluding graphics, real world scenarios, and interview practice. Users can review the tax law material, listen to mock \ninterviews, and complete sample tax return preparation scenarios. This training prepares SPEC partners and volunteers \nto provide quality tax return preparation services in their local communities. \nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nVITA Program Overview and Requirements\b\n5\nVITA/TCE Courses and Certifications\nVolunteer Standards of Conduct – New volunteers must complete the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) Train­\ning.

The IRS provides the tax preparation software to use.\n•   \u0007Submit all required forms timely to the local territory, such as:\n ˚ Form 13715, Volunteer Site Information Sheet. This information is transferred to an IRS data base and is sub­\nsequently used to inform the public of the site location, hours of operation, and other pertinent information. It is \nused to track program performance.\n ˚ Form 13206, Volunteer Assistance Summary Report. Listing of all volunteers working at VITA sites and in­\ncludes the dates the volunteers received certification and their level of training.\n ˚ Form 13533, VITA/TCE Partner Sponsor Agreement. A signed commitment to serve as a partner for the VITA \nan TCE Programs and uphold all required standards.  \n•  Follow all the Quality Site Requirements. An explanation of these requirements is outlined later in this publication.\n•  \u0007Ensure volunteers are properly trained to the level of returns they prepare. The IRS provides electronic and printed \ntraining materials. Information on training availability can be found in Publication 5683 or at www.irs.gov, keyword \nsearch Link & Learn Taxes or Volunteer Training Curriculums.\n•  Monitor the quality and technical proficiency of your volunteers on an on-going basis.\n•  Conduct meetings, issue newsletters, and establish other means of communications to share tax law and other \nadministrative information with your volunteers.\n•  Consider conducting quality site and return reviews to ensure sites are operating in accordance with the IRS and \nyour established procedures. Note: This is not a requirement of the VITA Program, however, it is recommended. For \nVITA Grant recipients, these reviews provide you assurance that your sites are adhering to the terms and conditions \nof the grant.\n•  \u0007Ensure appropriate record keeping is in place for completing all grant reporting including the final report narrative.\n•  Ensure ethical operation and implementation of the VITA Program to ensure taxpayer confidence in the program.\nThe IRS identified ten practices, Quality Site Requirements (QSR), to ensure taxpayers visiting volunteer sites receive \nquality service and accurate return preparation. Each taxpayer using the services offered through the VITA program \nshould be confident they are receiving accurate return preparation and quality service. All volunteer tax preparation sites \nin the VITA program must adhere to these requirements.\nQSR #1 – Certification\nVolunteers must complete their certifications using the IRS electronic tests through Link & Learn Taxes (LLT). Volunteers \ncan use Form 6744, VITA/TCE Volunteer Assistor’s Test/Retest, as a tool to prepare for the certification tests. Volunteers’ \nnames and addresses in LLT must match their government issued photo identification. SPEC recommends that volun­\nteers update their My Account page in LLT with their valid name and address.\nNew and returning volunteers must take the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) Training. SPEC encourages returning \nvolunteers to review the VSC training as a refresher. Annually, all VITA volunteers must pass the VSC certification test \nwith a score of 80% or higher prior to working at a site. The training and certification test are available on Link & Learn \nTaxes and in Publication 4961, VITA/TCE Volunteer Standards of Conduct – Ethics Training.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nVITA Program Overview and Requirements\b\n7\nNew volunteer instructors, preparers, coordinators, and quality reviewers must review Publication 5101, VITA/TCE \nIntake/Interview and Quality Review Training. Annually, all volunteer instructors, preparers, coordinators, and quality \nreviewers must pass the Intake/Interview & Quality Review certification test. Volunteer greeters, screeners and client \nfacilitators who assign tax returns to preparers or assist taxpayers with completing Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and \nQuality Review Sheet, must also take this training and certify. \nVolunteers who answer tax law questions, instruct tax law classes, prepare, or correct tax returns, and/or conduct quality \nreviews of completed tax returns must certify in tax law prior to conducting tax law related tasks. Tax law certification \nis an annual requirement. Volunteers who do not help with tax law related issues (for example, greeters, receptionists, \nequipment coordinators, etc.) are not required to certify in tax law but must still complete the VSC certification test. \nAll coordinators and alternate coordinators must review Publication 5088, VITA/TCE Site Coordinator Training. Site \ncoordinator training is an annual requirement. All coordinators and alternate coordinators must pass the Site Coordinator \nTest certification with a score of 80% or higher prior to performing any site coordinator duties. \nVolunteers may complete their training by classroom, self-study, or Link & Learn Taxes. Refer to Publication 5683, VITA/\nTCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators for a complete illustration of the certification process.\nAARP Foundation Tax-Aide uses the information from SPEC’s training materials to create their own training materials \nfor both Site Coordinator training and Intake/Interview and Quality Review Training. They provide all required training for \nvolunteers who instruct, prepare and quality review tax returns. In addition to being covered during their face-to-face \ntraining sessions, all volunteers receive appropriate training materials by email and are asked to review those materials \nagain prior to reporting to their sites.\nQSR #2 – Intake/Interview & Quality Review Process\nIntake and Interview – All sites must use Form 13614-C, Intake/Interview and Quality Review Sheet, for every tax \nreturn prepared by an IRS-certified volunteer. Form 13614-C guides the IRS-tax law certified volunteer preparer through \nthe interview with the taxpayer and allows them to gather all necessary information for correct return preparation. The \nvolunteer quality reviewer uses the completed tax return, the taxpayer’s supporting documentation and the completed \nForm 13614-C, to verify the tax return is free from error. Volunteers must also verify that the tax return is within the scope \nof the VITA/TCE Programs and the volunteer’s certification level. If the return is out-of-scope for VITA/ TCE, the site will \nnot be able to prepare that taxpayer’s return.  The taxpayer may need to obtain the assistance of a professional preparer.  \nVolunteers should avoid referring taxpayers to any particular paid preparer.\nQuality Review – Every site should ensure that a complete quality review process is used to confirm that tax law was \ncorrectly applied, and the tax return is free from error, based on the taxpayer interview and the available supporting \ndocuments. The quality reviewers should be experienced IRS tax law-certified volunteers. VITA sites conduct reviews by \na designated reviewer or a peer-to-peer reviewer, as self-review is not an approved method. \nQSR #3 – Confirming Photo Identification and Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN)\nCoordinators must have a process in place to confirm taxpayers’ identities and Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN). \nAll volunteers must follow verification procedures prior to tax return preparation and before a taxpayer signs a VITA \nprepared tax return and receives a copy of the return. This process must include using acceptable documents to confirm \ntaxpayers’ identities and TIN by reviewing:\n•  Photo identification (ID) for taxpayer (and spouse, if married filing jointly); and\n•  Social Security Numbers (SSN) and Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) for everyone listed on the tax \nreturn\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nVITA Program Overview and Requirements\b\n8\nQSR #4 – Reference Materials\nAll sites must have, in paper or electronic form, the following reference materials available for use by IRS-certified volun­\nteers:\n•  Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax (For Individuals)\n•  Publication 4012, VITA/TCE Volunteer Resource Guide\n•  Publication 4299, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Civil Rights – A Public Trust\n•  Volunteer Tax Alerts (VTA) and Quality Site Requirement Alerts (QSRA) or CyberTax Alerts issued by Tax-Aide\nPublications 17, 4012, and 4299 are available for download on IRS.gov, or by opening the VITA/TCE Publications and \nUser Guides option on the navigation bar when signed into TaxSlayer. VTA and QSRA are available on the Site Coordi­\nnator Corner on IRS.gov. CyberTax Alerts are available on the AARP Foundation Tax-Aide website.\nQSR #5 – Volunteer Agreement\nAnnually, all  volunteers (coordinators, return preparers, quality reviewers, greeters, screeners, client facilitators, etc.) \nmust complete the Volunteer Standards of Conduct (VSC) certification. This includes signing and dating Form 13615, \nVolunteer Standards of Conduct Agreement – VITA/TCE Programs, agreeing to follow the VSC. \nThe partner’s approving official must also certify Form 13615 (sign and date). This confirms that the partner’s approving \nofficial has verified the volunteer’s identity, name, and address, using government-issued photo identification. The \npartner must also confirm the volunteer has passed the required IRS training certification test(s), and the volunteer has \nsigned and dated Form 13615. \nQSR #6 – Timely Filing of Tax Returns\nAll coordinators must have a process in place to ensure every tax return is timely electronically filed or delivered to \nthe taxpayer. For e-filed tax returns, Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization, is required to be signed by the \ntaxpayer (and spouse if married filing jointly), which gives the site permission to e-file their tax return. Actions required to \nguarantee tax returns are filed timely include:\n•  Ensuring that tax returns are submitted to IRS within three calendar days after the site has all necessary information \nto e-file the tax return.\n•  Retrieving acknowledgements timely (preferably within 48 hours of transmission).\n•  Promptly working rejects that can be corrected by the IRS-tax law certified volunteer.\n•  Timely notifying taxpayers (attempted within 24 hours) if rejects cannot be corrected.\n•  For filing paper returns, provide the taxpayer with a completed tax return and the correct mailing address for the \nIRS center that processes paper tax returns. Remind the taxpayer to sign the return before mailing it. \n•  Promptly notifying taxpayers if any other problems are identified with tax return processing.\nQSR #7 – Civil Rights\nInformation about civil rights must be available to all taxpayers who seek services at all VITA sites. Taxpayers must have \naccess to the civil rights information even if they do not have a tax return prepared.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nVITA Program Overview and Requirements\b\n9\nQSR #8 – Correct Site Identification Number (SIDN)\nIt is critical that the correct Site Identification Number (SIDN) is reported on all tax returns prepared by VITA sites. E-file \nadministrators set tax software defaults to ensure the correct SIDN automatically appears on each tax return.\nQSR #9 – Correct Electronic Filing Identification Number (EFIN)\nThe correct Electronic Filing Identification Number (EFIN) is required to be used on every tax return prepared. All appli­\ncants must use the online IRS e-file application process located in E-Services to apply for an EFIN or update an appli­\ncation. A separate EFIN is required for each physical location. E-file administrators set the tax software defaults to \nensure the correct EFIN automatically appears on Form 8879, IRS e-file Authorization.\nQSR #10 – Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality\nSites must follow all security, privacy, and confidentiality guidelines as outlined in Publication 4299, Privacy, Confi­\ndentiality, and Civil Rights – A Public Trust. A copy (paper or electronic) of this publication must be available at every \nsite and used when referring to security, privacy, confidentiality, and civil rights issues. Publication 4299 is the resource \ndocument for providing guidance on securing and protecting personally identifiable information (PII) shared by taxpayers, \nvolunteers, and partners.\nAll coordinators must have security procedures in place as described in Publication 4299 for the following processes:\nPreparing an annual security plan to safeguard taxpayer data. (Sites can use Form 15272, VITA/TCE Security Plan, or a \nsimilar document that captures the same information.) \n•  Protecting all computers with passwords.\n•  Using a hard-wired internet connection or encrypted and password-protected wireless internet connections.\n•  Securing computers, printers, and all equipment after site operating hours.\n•  Safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) at the site by safely storing and/or properly disposing of the \ninformation.\n•  Securing IRC Section 7216 consent notices as required.\n•  Limiting volunteer access privileges to the tax software based on assigned roles.\n•  Restricting volunteer access to the tax software after operating hours.\n•  Deactivating usernames in the tax software when volunteers quit, resign, or are no longer working at the site.\nTo help prevent identity theft at VITA and TCE sites, IRS-certified volunteers must identify themselves to the taxpayer’s \nthey assist. Volunteers at in-person sites must wear or display name identification, including work identification badges, \nIRS name badges, and Tax-Aide name badges. At a minimum, this identification must include the full first name and first \nletter of the volunteer’s last name. Form 14509, Volunteer ID Insert, is an optional product developed for volunteers to \ndisplay their names. Virtual sites can use electronic means to provide the volunteer’s name to the taxpayers.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nVITA Program Overview and Requirements\b\n10\nAdditional information on the Quality Site Requirements can be found in the following locations:\n•  Publication 5683, VITA/TCE Handbook for Partners and Site Coordinators.\n•  Publication 5166, VITA/TCE Volunteer Quality Site Requirements\n•  www.irs.gov – Key word search: Quality Site Requirement\nCustomer Service Requirements\nTo establish the greatest degree of public trust all volunteers have a responsibility to provide quality customer service and \nuphold the highest ethical standards. All volunteers must adhere to the following standards of conduct:\n1.\t\nFollow the Quality Site Requirements.\n2.\t\nNot accept payment, solicit donations, or accept refund payments for federal or state tax return preparation from \ncustomers.\n3.\t\nNot solicit business from taxpayers assisted or use knowledge gained (from their information) about taxpayers for \nany direct or indirect personal benefit for the volunteer or any other specific individual.\n4.\t\nNot knowingly prepare false returns.\n5.\t\nNot engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, notoriously disgraceful conduct, or any other conduct deemed to \nhave a negative effect on the VITA/TCE Programs.\n6.\t\nTreat all taxpayers in a professional, courteous, and respectful manner.\nBecause the VITA grant is in support of the VITA Program, grant recipients are required to follow all existing guidance governing \nVITA site operations and shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance of violating federal laws governing \nvoluntary tax compliance. Whether circumstances create an appearance that the law or these standards have been violated \nshall be determined by the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts.\nFailure to comply with these standards could result in, but is not limited to, the following:\n•  \u0007Removal from all VITA/TCE programs and designation on the IRS volunteer registry to bar future work;\n•  \u0007Deactivation of the sponsoring partner’s site VITA/TCE EFIN;\n•  \u0007Removal of all IRS products, supplies, loaned equipment, and taxpayer information from your site;\n•  Termination of the sponsoring organization’s partnership with the IRS;\n•  Termination of grant agreement between the IRS and sponsoring partner; and\n•  \u0007Referral for potential Treasury Inspector General of Tax Administration (TIGTA) or criminal investigation.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nEligibility Requirements\b\n11\nEligibility Requirements\nHow Do I Determine If I Am Eligible?\nTo be eligible for funding under the VITA Grant Program, applicants must meet the following requirements:\n•  Be an eligible organization\n•  Be compliant with federal tax and information reporting requirements\n•  \u0007Provide matching funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis for all VITA funds awarded\n•  \u0007Be eligible to receive federal financial assistance (not be debarred or suspended or have federal debt preventing \nthe award of federal financial assistance)\n•  \u0007Have an audit completed when required by 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F – Audit Requirements\n•  \u0007File all required reports timely if a previous VITA or TCE grant recipient\nEligible Organization\nThe applicant must already be classified as one of the following.\n•  \u0007A private or public non-profit organization that qualified for and received an IRS determination letter confirming the \norganization’s tax exemption under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, including but not limited to credit \nunions, and faith based and community organizations\n•  A public, nonprofit, or proprietary (privately owned profit-making) college, university, vocational school, or other \npostsecondary educational institution located in the United States and Puerto Rico that has not been disqualified \nfrom participating in a student aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education\n•  A local government agency\n•  \u0007A federally recognized Indian Tribal government, or\n•  \u0007A regional, statewide, or local coalition with one lead organization that meets one of the eligibility requirements \nnoted above.

Section 501(c) (4) organizations may apply. However, if awarded a grant, federal law will prohibit your \norganization from lobbying.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nEligibility Requirements\b\n12\nTip: Eligible entities may only submit one application for consideration per grant period.\nThe applicant that applies on behalf of a group of organizations is responsible for ensuring all participants within their \ncoalition adhere to VITA Grant Program requirements. Effective monitoring and communication processes are required \nto ensure adherence to both financial management and program requirements. Grant applicants are responsible for \nensuring coalition members understand the role they play in delivering a successful VITA Grant Program and the \nprocesses by which funds are requested and distributed. The applicant is the only organization that is given access to \nthe funds if awarded. After the award is made, an agreement (contract, letter of intent or memorandum of understanding) \nis required between the VITA Grant recipient and its coalition members (sub-recipients) to ensure adherence to program \nguidelines, that monies are expended on approved purposes, and that matching funds documentation is maintained.\nTip: All sub-recipient entities must have a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI).\nTax Compliance\nThe organization submitting an application must be in compliance prior to award, during award consideration, and must \nremain in compliance throughout the grant period with their federal tax and information reporting requirements. This \nincludes filing all required federal information and tax returns and payment of all federal tax, penalties, and interest. The \nGPO will check the last five years of IRS records to confirm compliance on organizations recommended for award. The \nname shown in the application must agree with IRS records. Organizations determined to be ineligible or not recom­\nmended for award are not researched for tax compliance; therefore, existing problems with tax compliance may not be \nidentified on all applicants during a previous application period.\nExamples of non-compliance include:\n•  \u0007A balance due on the account\n•  \u0007An account with required federal information or tax returns not filed\n•  \u0007An Employer Identification Number (EIN) that belongs to a different entity than shown on the application\nIf a balance is found or a return is not filed and a filing requirement exists, we will send an email to the applicant notifying \nthem of a potential tax related issue. The applicant is given five business days to respond. Contact phone numbers for \ntax compliance information are included on the inside front cover of this publication.\n1.\t\nIf the applicant does not respond, the organization is ineligible for consideration.\n2.\t\nIf the applicant agrees that there is a balance owed, the organization may be ineligible for consideration even if the \nbalance is paid after our notification.\n3.\t\nIf the applicant disagrees with the balance and provides evidence showing that it is an error on the part of the\t\nInternal Revenue Service and we agree, the organization remains eligible for consideration.\n4.\t\nIf the applicant provides information that they are not liable for filing a return, the organization must submit a state­\nment; and when applicable, contact IRS to have the filing requirement corrected.\n5.\t\nIf the applicant is liable for filing a return, the organization is ineligible for consideration if they are unable to con­\nfirm that they previously submitted the return to the IRS.\nDo not assume that you are tax compliant. Have the person in your organization responsible for filing returns (including \nemployment tax returns) contact the IRS to check for any monies owed or returns not filed prior to submitting your appli­\ncation. Contact phone numbers for tax compliance verification are included on the inside front cover of this publication.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nEligibility Requirements\b\n13\nIf you identify any issues with federal tax compliance, be sure to indicate this on the SF 424, block 20, and attach a \nstatement explaining the issue. The SF 424 provides additional space for explaining any federal debt at the end of the \nform. For example, if a return was not filed because it was not required, include a statement containing the reason, the \ntype of return (i.e., Form 990, 940, 941, etc.), and the tax period. If you are working with someone at the IRS to resolve \nan outstanding issue, please provide their name, office in which they work, and their phone number. Similar statements \nshould be submitted for monies owed or incorrect entity information. Sample justification statements are listed below.\n•  We were not required to file the 2012 first quarter Form 941 because we did not have any employees.\n•  We filed a Form 8868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File an Exempt Organization Return, on May \n15, 2016, for an automatic three month extension to August 15, 2016, for our 2015 Form 990\n•  We are working with Ms. Green, IRS Office, at xxx.xxx.xxxx to resolve a problem on the 2014 first quarter Form \n941. It was incorrectly posted under an erroneous EIN.\n•  \u0007There is a penalty owed on our Form 940 for 2014; however, a determination was made that it was erroneous and it \nis being reversed. We are working with Mr. Smith, IRS Office, at xxx.xxx.xxxx.\nSelf disclosure of situations where returns are not filed and/or monies are owed do not automatically qualify you as \neligible for this grant. Information submitted about tax compliance issues you identified are considered on the specific \nmerits of the situation.\nApplicants must submit a Form 14335, Contact Information for VITA and TCE Grant Programs, with every appli­\ncation. Make sure this form is completed in its entirety and that the person listed as the tax matters contact on the Form \n14335 is a person authorized to receive and discuss the return information of the applicant. The GPO will utilize this \ncontact for any tax compliance questions.\nCost Sharing or Matching Funds\nThis grant requires 100% cost sharing or matching of all federal funds awarded. For every federal dollar awarded, the \napplicant must commit an equal amount. For example, if you request $50,000 in grant funds, you must provide matching \nfunds for at least $50,000. Only funds in support of the VITA Program qualify as matching funds.\nThe Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 CFR Part \n200, states that all contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the grantee’s cost \nsharing or matching when such contributions:\n1.\t\nAre verifiable from the non-federal entity’s (recipient’s) records;\n2.\t\nAre not included as contributions for any other federal award;\n3.\t\nAre necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of project or program objectives;\n4.\t\nAre allowable under 2 CFR Part 200 Subpart E - Cost Principles;\n5.\t\n\u0007Are not paid by the federal government under another federal award, except where the federal statute authorizing \na program specifically provides that federal funds made available for such program can be applied to matching or \ncost sharing requirements of other federal programs;\n6.\t\nAre provided for in the approved budget when required by the federal awarding agency; and\n7.\t\nConform to other provisions of 2 CFR Part 200, as applicable.\nThird party in-kind contributions, defined in 2 CFR 200.96, means the value of non-cash contributions (i.e., property \nor services) that (a) benefit a federally assisted project or program; and (b) are contributed by non-federal third parties, \nwithout charge, to a non-federal entity under a federal award. For the VITA Grant program, examples of third party \nin-kind contributions are computers, printers, space, volunteer time, interpreter services, or supplies.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nEligibility Requirements\b\n14\nThere is no prohibition on counting student services for which academic credit is given, nor other services for which \nservice providers receive some benefit from a third party, as a proper basis of meeting the matching fund requirements \nas a third party in-kind contribution that otherwise complies with 2 CFR 200.96.\nThe amount of matching funds offered by the applicant (including from other sources) should be recorded in blocks \n18b-e depending on the source of the funds, of the SF 424. It must equal or exceed the amount in block 18a.\nAdditional information on cost sharing or matching funds can be found in the Budget Information section of this publi­\ncation.\nDebarment or Suspension\nAs part of the application, you are required to provide certain certifications and assurances. One of these certifica­\ntions is the Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters – Primary Covered \nTransactions. As part of eligibility, the GPO will check the individuals listed on the Application for Federal Assistance, \nStandard Form 424, and key individuals in the Program and Financial Operations narratives to ensure they are not \ndebarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for a federal award. You may check this yourself before \napplying by visiting the System for Award Management (SAM) maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA). \nIf you identify incorrect information about your organization or individuals within your organization, you should contact \nthe agency that reported the information.\nAudits Under the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit \nRequirements of Federal Awards, 2 CFR Part 200\nAudit requirements applicable to grant award recipients have been described in 2 CFR Part 200.501. If your organization \nexpends $750,000 or more in a year in federal funds, your organization must have a single or program specific audit for \nthat year. \nThe Federal Audit Clearinghouse operates on behalf of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and its primary \npurpose is to disseminate audit information to federal agencies and the public. If the most recent audit showed an \nunfavorable finding, it will not automatically disqualify you from consideration; however, more information may be \nrequested to ensure any deficiencies noted in the audit have been corrected. Detailed information can be obtained from \n2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F - Audit Requirements (formerly OMB Circular A-133). The GPO will review the audit reports \nlocated at https://harvester.census.gov/facweb/.\nTimely Submission of Reports\nIf your organization received a VITA Grant or a Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) grant in prior years, we will determine \nif all required reporting was completed and submitted timely. If it is not and a request to delay reporting was not \napproved, the applicant is ineligible for a grant during this announcement period. Submitting required reports timely is a \nprerequisite for consideration of future grant opportunities.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nBefore Starting Your Application\b\n15\nBefore Starting Your Application\nBefore submitting a grant application, all organizations should ensure they meet basic eligibility as explained in the \nprevious section and then take the following actions:\n•  \u0007Secure a Unique Entity Identifier Number \n•  \u0007Register with the System for Award Management (SAM)\n•  \u0007Register with www.grants.gov in order to receive updates and to submit application electronically.\n•  Determine if application is subject to review by the state under Executive Order 12372.\nPlease keep the following in mind as you complete the application.\nUnique Entity Identifier (UEI)\nThe General Services Administration (GSA) generates and provides a non-proprietary Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) at \nwww.sam.gov for identifying entities during the awards process for things like contracts, grants and cooperative agree­\nments in SAM and other systems. GSA is streamlining the UEI request, registration, and support process by allowing \nentities to handle all three through SAM.\nUEIs are 12-character alpha-numeric values — all letters are capitalized. The final character will be a checksum of the \nfirst 11 to detect errors in data. UEIs won’t use the letters O or I to avoid confusion or use nine-digit sequences like the \nDUNS number.\nSystem for Award Management (SAM)\nSystem for Award Management (SAM) is the primary registrant database of contracts and assistance awards for the \nfederal government. The purpose of the SAM is to facilitate paperless payment through electronic funds transfer. The \nregistration process also provides basic information relevant to procurement and financial transactions.\nAll applicants must register with SAM, maintain an active registration during the application and evaluation period and \nthen throughout the period of the grant and final reporting. Register early. Please give yourself plenty of time before the \napplication submission deadline. Plan on 10 business days after you submit and receive a message that your request \nis complete for your registration to be active in SAM, then give yourself an additional 2 business days for Grants.gov to \nrecognize your information so that you can submit the grant application.\nIf already registered in SAM, renewal of the registration is required annually. Check when your registration will expire and \nupdate. You may update as often as you want but at least once per year. The complete resource for SAM registration is \nlocated at www.sam.gov.\nAll entities registering for All Awards or Federal Assistance Only, will be required to review the Financial Assistance \nRepresentations and Certifications. These are a common set of certifications and representations required by Federal \nstatutes or regulations in accordance with grant guidance under Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. If you intend \nto apply or are a recipient of a Federal grant or cooperative agreement, you must agree to the grant’s certifications and \nrepresentations in the Representations and Certifications section of your entity registration. A list of these certifications is \nincluded in Appendix A, Exhibit 2, however your agreement MUST be made in www.sam.gov.\nOnce you are registered in SAM, SAM will provide advance notification to you when you need to renew your registration. \nThis must be done annually in order to maintain active status. Visit www.sam.gov for more information. Failure to \nmaintain an active registration in SAM will result in non-consideration of your application.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nBefore Starting Your Application\b\n16\nGrants.gov Registration\nAll applications must be submitted using Grants.gov and now that your SAM registration is active, you’re ready to \nregister on Grants.gov. If you’re already registered, have users in your organization check to make sure they have a \ncurrent password and the proper permissions to perform the required actions. Grants.gov offers numerous applicant \nresources to assist in registering and using the system. Once at Grants.gov select the “Applicants” tab. The applicant \nactions provide step-by-step instructions for applying for a grant and tracking an application. Also, check out applicant \nresources for user guides, checklists, animated tutorials, web casts, and frequently asked questions. For registration \nassistance, review Applicant Registration for the actions required to complete this step.\nPlease register early and take advantage of the many aids at Grants.gov to become familiar with the submission process \nand alleviate any last minute frustrations with submission. Please do not wait until the last day to submit your application \non Grants.gov. The application must be submitted by the application due date in order to be considered timely. Some \nproblems encountered require that you update SAM and changes are not completed in real-time. It is frustrating to \ncomplete all the components of the application and then find that your SAM registration is expired and will not reactivate \nprior to the submission deadline.\nWe’ve also added additional instructions to this publication to assist in labeling the files submitted as part of your Grants.\ngov application.\nOnce all registrations are complete, it is time to start your application. The application will be available for download from \nGrants.gov beginning May 1. On the Grants.gov website, locate “Apply for Grants” under the “Applicants” tab. Follow \nthe instructions to download the application using the Assistance Listing Number 21.009.\nState Review Required Under Executive Order 12372\nExecutive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, was issued with the desire to foster the inter­\ngovernmental partnership and strengthen federalism by relying on state and local processes for the coordination and \nreview of proposed federal financial assistance and direct federal development. The Order allows each state to designate \nan entity to perform this function. Review the State Point of Contact (SPOC) List at the National Archives website (type \nSPOC List in the search field). to determine if your state is participating.  States that are not listed have chosen not to \nparticipate in the intergovernmental review process. If you are located within a state that has chosen not to participate, \nyou may send application materials directly to a federal awarding agency. Follow state instructions, if applicable. Please \ncheck the appropriate item in block 19 of SF 424. See Appendix B, Additional Aids in Applying for a Grant, Exhibit 3 – \nIntergovernmental Review (SPOC List). \nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nWhat to Include in the Application\b\n17\nWhat to Include in the Application\nAll required application components must be submitted through Grants.gov.

If the statistics show a reduction in returns, \nsites, or volunteers year-to-year, explain why.\n•  Number the pages of your narrative so reviewers can easily identify missing pages.\n•  Limit attachments to only vital information. Choose judiciously the attachments included. Ask whether they \nstrengthen your package before including in the application.\n•  Use forms when provided to ensure needed information is not overlooked. Organizations that use recommended \nforms (e.g., Forms 13977 and 13978) generally score higher because all required information is provided and \nindividuals reviewing the application can more easily locate key data.\n•  Ensure individuals responsible for submitting and approving applications have a valid Grants.gov login and \npassword well in advance of the application due date.\n•  Ensure information agrees throughout the application. For example, line 20, Federal Funds Proposed Expenditures, \non Form 13978, Projected Operations VITA Grant Application,  should agree with the amount of funds \nrequested on the SF 424.\n•  Complete all required forms, certifications, and narratives.\n•  Double check all calculations.\n•  Review the application package prior to submission and use more than one reviewer.\n•  Label the application package correctly.\n•  Prepare your application early. Don’t wait until the last day to submit to Grants.gov. After submitting your application \nto Grants.gov allow 48 hours for validation just in case errors are encountered. Some error corrections may require \novernight processing before they are corrected.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nApplication for Federal Assistance, Standard Form 424\b\n20\nApplication for Federal Assistance, Standard Form 424\nThis form is required for all grant applications.

All \nmulti-year recipients in year 2 or year 3 must submit a civil rights narrative and financial operations narrative. Multi-year \nrecipients must submit a program narrative highlighting changes to your program.\nIs there anything in this section that will cause my application to be rejected if I miss it?\nFailure to provide a narrative will result in non-consideration of the application. Failure to explain all components will \nprevent maximum points from being awarded during the technical evaluation.\nThings To Note:\n•  \u0007Keep the reader in mind. Reviewers will use only the information contained in the application to assess the \nprogram plan. The applicant should ensure responses are complete and clearly written.\n•  Explain everything. In order to remain impartial the individual reviewing your application knows nothing about your \norganization’s program.\n•  Follow the instructions and application guidance carefully. The application provides instructions for the proper \norganization and labeling of materials. Present information in the requested format.\n•  Label all sections and number all attachments. Include page numbers so you can direct the reader back to the \nsection easily.\n•  \u0007Utilize program coordinator for thorough understanding of processes. Many of the topics requested in the \nprogram plan narrative require close coordination with the program and/or site coordinator that oversees return \npreparation. Understanding program requirements ensures plans are communicated thoroughly.\n•  Use forms when provided. Use of forms provides reviewers easy access to key information. Reviewers may \nmiss key information when it is buried in a narrative. Forms 13977 and 13978 are provided to capture prior \nyear performance, proposed returns, sites, primary and secondary focus, matching funds information, budget \nexpenses, corporate felony convictions, cash sub-awards, and related party transactions. These are available on \nthe VITA Grant web page and with the Grants.gov announcement.\n•  Be brief, concise, and clear. Make each point understandable. Provide accurate and honest information, \nincluding candid accounts of problems and realistic plans to address them. If any requested information is omitted, \nexplain why. If providing information in tables, charts, or attachments, make sure they are labeled and consistent.\n•  Be organized and logical. Many applications fail because the reviewers cannot follow the thought process of the \napplicant or because parts don’t fit together or are contradictory.\n•  \u0007Combine data. If submitting on behalf of a coalition, combine the data for the overall plan, such as prior return \npreparation performance. Combine the results from all participants that will be funded by the program into one \ntable.\n•  \u0007Carefully proofread the application. Misspellings and grammatical errors will impede reviewers in understanding \nthe application. Be sure to number all pages including any attachments.\n•  \u0007Double check. Have someone familiar with your program read the narrative to ensure all sections are answered \nand completely explained.\n•  Adhere to limits and formats requested. Keep the narrative to 55 pages, double spaced, Arial or Calibri font \n12. The page limit does not include attachments; however, attachments should not be used to circumvent the \nnarrative page limits. \nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nNarrative\b\n24\nThis section is designed to solicit information concerning your qualifications and the plan you propose for use of the \nVITA Grant. The information provided here is used to evaluate your organization’s potential to achieve the objectives of \nthe VITA Grant Program as reflected in the “VITA Grant Objectives” section of this publication. Please provide specific \nresponses to the required items listed below and provide enough detail so that your application can be fully considered. \nClose coordination with program coordinators is necessary to ensure requirements are fully addressed. Keep your \ncomments concise and relevant.\nTip: If applying as the lead on behalf of other organizations, do not submit separate documents for each sub-recipient. \nYou should summarize the information for the application. For example, if multiple methods of training are utilized and/or \nquality review is conducted, talk about the range of training offered or that most sites used a dedicated quality reviewer.\nI.  Program Plan Section\nA.  Experience with Low Income and/or Return Preparation – 0-64 points\n1.  Describe your experience working with low-to-moderate-income taxpayers, persons with disabilities, persons \nwith limited English proficiency, Native Americans, individuals living in rural ares, members of the Armed \nForces and their spouses, and the elderly, both outside of and within the VITA/TCE programs. Include any \nyear-round efforts your organization coordinates or participates in. Include any efforts your organization has \ntaken to provide financial education and asset building to these same populations. Some examples of financial \neducation and asset building activities may include Individual Development Accounts (IDA), credit counseling \nworkshops, home buyer workshops, assistance in opening bank accounts, foreclosure workshops, identity \ntheft workshops, etc.\nTip: Your description should include what is done, how it is done, and provide adequate details to demonstrate how you \nreach the targeted underserved population, including collaborative outreach efforts.\n2.  \u0007Describe your prior experience coordinating and operating an IRS volunteer return preparation program. Tell us \nthe number of years your organization (or sub-recipient organization) has participated in the VITA or TCE program.\n3.  \u0007Provide an itemized list of the three most recent years that your organization has been involved in the volunteer \nreturn preparation program. Include the source of your information. Please use the format shown below. \nBe sure to only report production for the activities that are covered by the VITA Grant. For example, adjust \nproduction for the overall coalition by subtracting the returns and sites operated by AARP Tax-Aide or by \norganizations that will not be funded by this request. Remember to include the following information:\n•  Current and prior year returns prepared and electronically filed by VITA volunteers;\n•  Returns prepared and filed by customers through facilitated self-assistance VITA sites; and\n•  Paper returns filed by VITA site customers and containing an accurate SIDN.\n•  Returns not included in the count above, such as Form 1040X.\n•  Please explain any reductions in the service from year-to-year. If submitting on behalf of a coalition of \npartners, summarize the information overall and do not provide information for each partner here. You may \nattach individual performance information by partner if you wish.\nCalendar Year\nTotal federal returns prepared \n% e-filed \n# of volunteers\n4.  \u0007Explain if you used MyFreeTaxes and whether you included these returns in the reported production above.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nNarrative\b\n25\nB.  Strength of Program – 0-50 points\n1.  Describe the qualifications of the program coordinator(s) and financial administrator(s), whether funded or \nunfunded, that will support the VITA program. Discuss their:\n•  Education, volunteer return preparation program experience, relevant training, and cultural competency as it \nrelates to the target population;\n•  Roles, responsibilities and anticipated time the individuals will work with the VITA Program.\nNote: Do not include resumes or information on persons serving in minor support roles.\n2.  Describe your volunteer training plan. Plan should include, but is not limited to:\n•  Estimate of the total training hours per volunteer;\n•  Qualifications of instructors with regards to tax law and/or e-file processes;\n•  Method that you will use to train the volunteers, such as, Link & Learn Taxes, self-study, or classroom \ntraining, and the training materials used whether developed by you or the IRS; and\n•  Any unique training curriculum you have developed or identified that is not provided by the IRS. It could be \ntraining based on position held, such as tax return preparers, site coordinators, electronic return originators, \nscreeners, quality reviewers, IT support or other related to tax return preparation.\nNote: Do not provide a copy of the IRS training plan.\n3.  Document your strategy for recruiting and retaining volunteers.\n4.  Discuss your publicity plan. Be sure to address:\n•  The timeline for marketing your tax preparation program to the underserved community.\n•  The messages, methods, materials, and channels (media, posters, web site, etc.) to be used to reach the \nunderserved populations and hard to reach areas you will target.\n•  Any services being provided for special populations, e.g., interpreters for individuals hard of hearing.\n5.  Describe your access to technology. Be sure to:\n•  Document your organization’s current access to resources to e-file returns, including the availability of \ncomputers, printers, space, supplies, and the Internet.\n•  Address whether you are dependent on IRS computer resources or whether you have identified resources in \nthe community.\n•  Estimate the number of IRS computers and printers you or your coalition members anticipate using. If you \nwill not use IRS equipment (computers or printers), please state that no IRS equipment is used.\nC.  VITA Target Audience – 0-38 points\n1.  \u0007Describe your plans to focus on extending services to underserved populations (urban and non-urban) and \nhard to reach areas. Be sure to:\n•  Indicate a primary and secondary focus. Please provide relevant rationale and demographic data, citing \nsource, for your primary and secondary focus. Classify your primary and secondary focus as either low-to-\nmoderate income taxpayers, persons with disabilities, person with limited English proficiency, Native Ameri­\ncans, individuals living in rural areas, members of the Armed Forces and their spouses, and the elderly. You \ncan describe any other subsets of these populations in your narrative. Indicate the number of individuals \nyou propose to reach with your primary and secondary focus on Form 13978, Projected Operations VITA \nGrant Application. \n•  Discuss the underserved population, underserved geographic area, and/or hard to reach area your program \nwill target.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nNarrative\b\n26\nTip: Choose only one population as your primary focus and one population as your secondary focus. Geographic \ncoverage discussed in this section should agree with block 14 on the SF 424.\nCensus data can be very helpful in determining the area of focus needed for your geographic coverage. The following \ntools may provide additional information and data.\nThe American Community Survey provides information about the social and economic needs of your community every \nyear. Basic population data is available for all geographies with a population of 20,000 or more. However, sometimes the \nspecific market segment data is not yet available, such as for limited English proficient (LEP).\n2.  \u0007Provide the following information on page 2 of Form 13978.\n•  New sites proposed for next year. A general location is all that is required (city, state, county).\n•  Established sites from this year.\n ˚ Name of site\n ˚ Site address (city, state, county)\n ˚ Hours of operations\n ˚ Electronic filing identification number (EFIN) – this is a six-digit number– Site identification number (SIDN) \n– this is nine digits starting with the letter S followed by eight numbers, e.g.,S01021234.\n ˚ Facilitated self-assistance services offered\n ˚ dentify the sites that serve rural areas, special needs (LEP, persons with a disability, etc.), or are open \nyear-round.\n3.  Provide the number of federal tax returns you propose to accomplish and your strategy to achieve growth over \nthe prior period’s results. Please note that actual production expected of a recipient of this grant may differ \nfrom what is proposed. IRS considers production captured in IRS systems for the sites in your plan at time of \nevaluation, which can differ from the returns reported in the application because return preparation activities \nmay still be underway at time of application.\n4.  Provide the total number of volunteers you anticipate using in the program.\n5.  Discuss what you will do to handle an overflow of customers/taxpayers and how you will ensure the taxpayer \nreceives service.\n6.  Identify other service delivery methods, such as mobile; ad-hoc; facilitated self-assistance sites; virtual VITA sites; \nyear-round sites, and tell us why and to what degree you are planning to use this as a service delivery method.\nTip: Be sure to include all types of sites you will operate. This includes FSA, virtual, and year-round sites including sites \nwhere you complete prior year or amended returns.\nTo promote partner collaboration, sites may share the same physical location and volunteers. However, if the location \nis utilized by multiple grant recipients, associated costs must be apportioned so that no double charging occurs to \nthe grants and return production is not double counted. Separate SIDNs and EFINs will ensure production from each \nsponsored grant is clearly distinguishable.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nNarrative\b\n27\nD.  Ability to Partner or Collaborate with Multiple Organizations – 4 points\n1.  Describe your organization’s mission as it relates tothe targeted populations identified above. In addition, \ninclude a full explanation of your agency’s relationship with schools, government entities, community based \nnon-profits or for-profit organizations.\n2.  Describe the roles and responsibilities of each collaborating organization, to include contributions of each, \nsuch as:\n•  Space provided for site\n•  Equipment\n•  Training assistance\n•  Funding\n•  Advertising\n•  Publicity\n•  Supplies\n•  Internet connectivity\n•  FEAB services\n3.  Describe your organization’s role if you are a lead organization filing this application on behalf of a coalition; list \nall coalition partners’ names.\nE.  Sustainability and Growth Strategy – 0-4 points\n1.  Document your organization’s plans for sustaining and growing your program long term. Explain how you plan \nto grow and sustain your VITA Program long term. Include your strategy for:\n•  Increasing e-file capacity\n•  Securing additional funding sources including equipment acquisition\n•  Targeting of underserved populations\n•  Recruitment of volunteers\n•  Retention of volunteers\n•  Expansion of collaborative efforts among community organizations\nF.  Quality Control Process – 0-20 points\n1.  Explain the processes and procedures in place to ensure adherence to each of the IRS quality site \nrequirements.\n•  Certification of volunteers\n•  Intake/Interview process\n•  Quality review process\n•  Reference material availability (include a listing \nof what is available at the site)\n•  Timely filing of return\n•  Volunteer agreement\n•  Civil Rights notification\n•  Site identification (SIDN)\n•  Electronic filing identification (EFIN)\n•  Security, privacy and confidentiality\nSee Quality Site Requirements or Publication 5166, IRS Volunteer Quality Site Requirements, for more information. If any \nrequirements are addressed under another section of the program plan, please make reference as to where addressed.\nTip: Stating that you follow the ten quality site requirements is not sufficient. For example, for SIDN and EFIN use, \nyour plan should include how you ensure the correct EFIN and SIDN is used. Does the site coordinator have the users \nprint the set-up page and review it for accuracy? Are periodic checks made of the SIDN when e-filing or printing paper \nreturns? Another example would include the requirement for use of the Form 13614-C. Your plan would need to explain \nthe processes in place to ensure it is used in all instances. Are periodic checks done by the site coordinator? Does \nthe quality reviewer not approve a return until the Form 13614-C is used? These are only examples of the topics your \nplan should address and should not be assumed to be all inclusive.

These are considered \nmatching funds. Some federal grant programs may allow the use of their funds as matching on other federal grants. \nYou must confirm with the grantor of the funds and with the GPO before using these as matching funds. See \n“Federal Funds as Match” for more information.\n•  Please round figures to dollars only and no cents.\n•  \u0007Appendix B, Exhibit 1, Allowable/Unallowable Program Expenses, has a list of common expenses that are \nallowable or unallowable.\n•  \u0007Simplified method for recordkeeping available when utilizing volunteer services as match. See the section \n“Simplified Method for Volunteer Return Preparation Recordkeeping” for details.\nBudget Formulation\nAll expenses must be reasonable, necessary, and allocable to this grant. Documentation must be maintained on all \nexpenses, matching funds and donated services. Each line item does not require a dollar-for-dollar match. The total \nnon-federal funds must equal or exceed the total federal funds.\nIn general, expenses are only allowable if they are reasonable and are costs that would not have been incurred but for \nthe VITA Program. Appendix B contains two resources that are useful when formulating your budget. Exhibit 1 provides \na table of the most common allowable/unallowable program expenses. Please refer to these exhibits to determine if a \nproposed expense is covered. The following information provides general guidance on categories of expenses that are \nallowed for this grant. It also identifies special limitations that might fit into the category.\nA.\t Personnel (Salary) – Do not include fringe benefits with this calculation. Documentation includes daily timesheets \nfor the individuals covered. This is required for both employees and volunteers. If all time is not spent on the VITA \nProgram, the timesheets need to indicate the portion of time and activities attributable to the VITA Program. If a \ntimesheet is not required for a salaried employee, some other form of documentation is required to show time spent \non the VITA Grant program. This documentation must support the distribution of the employee’s salary among \nspecific activities or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and \nnon-Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities, which are \nallocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity. For paid \nstaff, records of payment are also required.\n\u0007Federal funds may only be used for certain positions directly involved in the VITA Program. They are: Program \ncoordinator, financial coordinator, site coordinator, clerical support, tax law instructor, quality reviewer, Financial \nEducation and Asset Building (FEAB) coordinator and information technology support. Other positions may be \nconsidered with prior approval. Federal funds may not be paid to individuals for the activities of screening or \npreparing tax returns.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nAward Notification\b\n43\n\u0007Non-federal funds paid to an individual directly performing service for the VITA Program may be used for matching. \nThere are limitations on the types of activities where federal funds can be used or where in-kind contribution can be \nclaimed as matching. If an employer other than the grant recipient furnishes the services of an employee to the \nVITA Program, these services are valued at the employee’s regular rate of pay (plus benefits but excluding overhead \ncosts) provided the services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid. If they are not in the \nsame skill, they will need to be adjusted to the amount of funds generally paid for the service performed. The value \nof these services is not reimbursable either as a direct or an indirect cost. The value is dependent on the service \nprovided and not on the salary or wage an individual is normally paid. For example, if a tax attorney is volunteering \nhis time for the VITA Program, his value would be determined by using the salary of a tax preparer and not of a tax \nattorney. The VITA Program does not require that he provide tax attorney service only tax preparation service. The \nvalue of in-kind volunteer services may be used as matching. Do not include value of volunteer services while \nreceiving training. Time spent instructing can be counted toward volunteer services as long as the instructor is not \npaid by the grant recipient.\nB.\t Fringe Benefits – Only include fringe benefits for individuals paid. These should not be included in the salary \ncalculations covered under category A or for contractual services under category F.\n1.   \u0007Federal funds may only be used to pay fringe benefits for certain positions directly involved in the VITA \nProgram. They are program, FEAB or site coordinator, quality reviewer, financial or clerical support, tax law \ninstructor, and information technology support. Federal funds may not be paid to individuals involved in the \nactivities of screening or preparing tax returns.\n2.  Non-federal funds used to pay these expenses may be used for matching when incurred by individuals directly \ninvolved in the delivery of the program.\nC.\t \u0007Travel – Documentation would include requests for payment such as a travel voucher and the payments made. \nSome expenses require the submission of additional receipts, such as air travel, hotel stays, etc.\n1.  Federal funds may be used to reimburse volunteers or employees for their travel to the site or training events. \nA stipend may be paid for travel reimbursement in lieu of actual mileage. The stipend may not be based on \nthe time a volunteer is engaged in volunteer service. Federal funds may also be used for travel required to \nValuing Volunteer and Paid Employee Time\nNot sure how to value volunteer activity or employees paid by other than the grant recipient for a different skill than \nnormally paid? The Occupational Employment Statistics program produces employment and wage estimates for over \n800 occupations. These are estimates of the number of people employed in certain occupations, and estimates of the \nwages paid to them. Self-employed persons are not included in the estimates. These estimates are available for the \nnation as a whole, for individual states, and for metropolitan areas; national occupational estimates for specific industries \nare also available.\nOne of the positions under the category Business and Financial Operations Occupations is Tax Preparers (Occupation \nCode 13-2082). Tax preparers are defined as persons who prepare tax returns for individuals but are not required to \nbe or have the responsibilities of an accredited or certified public accountant. For example, the mean hourly wage for \nthe state of Texas is $19.36 per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) May 2013 National Occupational Employment \nand Wage Estimates for the United States. However, note that the BLS data represents a wage rate only and can be \nadjusted by a reasonable fringe benefit amount in determining a volunteer in-kind valuation rate.\nInformation on other types of positions and for your metropolitan area or state can be found at: www.bls.gov/oes/\nhome.htm\nWhen reviewing your financial plan information, the GPO uses this information to determine if proposed salaries \nand/or in kind service values are reasonable.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nAward Notification\b\n44\naccomplish successful delivery of the program. Travel to meetings, seminars, etc., not directly related to the \ndelivery of the program is not covered. For mileage reimbursement to volunteers, the amount presently used \nby your organization to reimburse your own employees should be used. For trips that require overnight travel, \nreimbursement may include commercial transportation that is economy fare or discounted when available. \nMeals and lodging are limited to the applicable government per diem rate in effect at the time of travel.\n2.  Non-federal funds used to pay these expenses may be used for matching when incurred by individuals directly \ninvolved in the delivery of the program. \nD.\t Technology – Documentation would include receipts for items purchased and the payment records.\n1.  Federal funds may be used to purchase, lease or rent computer related technology to support the program. \nExamples of items covered in this category include computers, printers, projection equipment for training (not \na television), software, Internet connectivity, network cards, copier, etc. Technology purchased with federal \nfunds should remain in use in the program in future years or may be used to support other federal programs. \nEquipment may be used to support non-federal programs when use does not interfere with the purpose \nfor which it was purchased. Grant recipients may keep all technology purchased beyond the current year if \nparticipating in the VITA Program for an additional two years. The purchase of tax preparation software with \nVITA Grant funds is prohibited.​\nThe IRS provides tax preparation software annually to participants in the VITA Program that meet minimum \nproduction requirements at no cost. This category does not include disposable technology expenses such as \nprinter cartridges or back up media. These items are considered supplies. \n2.  Non-federal funds used to pay these expenses may be used for matching when incurred specifically for the \ndelivery of the program. Donated or loaned equipment may be included as matching and is valued at the fair \nmarket value of the property at the time of loan or donation. Equipment already on hand may be considered \nmatching as well but the value must reflect normal depreciation.\n3.  Special Limitations: The value of the donated equipment is not reimbursable either as a direct or indirect cost. \nIt may only be used as a source of matching funds.\nE.\t \u0007Supplies – Documentation would include receipts for items purchased and proof of payment .\n1.  Federal funds may be used to purchase general supplies needed for the program’s operation. This would \ninclude general office supplies such as pens, paper, staplers, staples, shredders, printer cartridges, copier \ntoner, cable locks, power cords, back up media, etc. It may also include storage cabinets for records and/or \nequipment. Desks and/or tables for tax preparation activities may also be purchased. \n2.  Non-federal funds used to pay these expenses may be used for matching when incurred specifically for the \ndelivery of the program. Donated or loaned supplies may be included as matching and matched at the fair \nmarket value of the property at the time of loan or donation.\n3.  Special Limitations: Federal funds used to purchase volunteer recognition are limited to $10 per volunteer. \nDonated goods, i.e., expendable personal property/supplies may be furnished to a non-profit organization. \nThe value of the goods is not reimbursable either as a direct or indirect cost. It may be used as a source of \nmatching funds.\nF.\t Contractual – Documentation would be contracts and payments.\n1.  Federal funds may be used for contractual agreements to provide specialty services such as an interpreter, \nappointment scheduling, space rental, etc. A contract for space rental may include such additional services \nas security, maintenance, and cleaning. If the contract covers the use of the service for other than the VITA \nProgram, only the portion directly attributable to the VITA Program may be charged. For example, a facility \nis used to support four programs and the VITA Program operates during 30% of the time. The cost of rental \nis $2,000 per month, it would be limited to 30% or $600 for only those months that the VITA Program is in \noperation.\n2.  Non-federal funds used to pay these expenses may be used for matching when incurred specifically for the \ndelivery of the program.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nAward Notification\b\n45\nG.\t \u0007Construction – This category is not applicable to this grant. No expenses are allowed.\nH.\t \u0007Other – Documentation would be receipts and proof of payment.\n1.  Federal funds may be used for other categories of items as well. Items such as publicity, audit services (when \nrequired because of the amount of federal funds expended), and installation of phone lines or Internet access \nare common expenses under this category for VITA grant recipients. Organizations may include the cost of \nfood and beverages provided for volunteers at VITA sites. It is an allowable expense as long as the purchase \nmeets all OMB established criteria (necessary, reasonable, allocable, and allowable). It must be a direct cost \n(not indirect) and incurred solely in support of the program. Total expenses for food and beverages may not \nexceed $500. Purchase of food and beverages for customers is not allowed because it is not in support of \nthe program. A reasonable proposal that includes this expense considers the number of volunteers, days and \nhours the site operates, length of the site session and type of food and beverages provided. The cost of food \nand beverages purchased in conjunction with an event such as volunteer training, is considered entertainment \nor social activity is not allowable.\n2.  Non-federal funds used to pay these expenses may be used for matching when incurred specifically for the \ndelivery of the VITA Program.\n3.  Special Limitations: Donated use of space may be furnished to a non-profit organization. The value of the \nspace is not reimbursable either as a direct or indirect cost. It may be used as matching.\n4.  Financial Education and Asset Building Services - Expenses associated with FEAB services are limited to 10% \nof the federal award amount.\nI.\t \u0007Indirect Charges – Limited to the grant recipient. Charges for expenses not directly related to the program but \nrequired for effective operation of the overall grant recipient. These charges might include such things as the \naccounting personnel tracking all expenses and/or processing time, maintenance, cleaning, insurance, security, etc. \nThe calculation of how indirect charges are assigned to the grant must be provided in each calculation. The Indirect \nCost Rate Agreement should be included with the application, if applicable. Organizations meeting the conditions \nestablished at 2 CFR 200.414(f) may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs.\n1.  Federal funds may be used to cover indirect charges as allowed in 2 CFR § 200.414 for the type of agency \napplying for a grant.\n2.  Indirect expenses, including general overhead of any entity administering the program, cannot be counted as \nmatching funds.\nIndirect Cost Rate Usage \nOrganizations may use an indirect cost rate. It must be indicated on the application Form 13977, VITA Grant Program \nBudget Plan (line 19) – Indirect Cost Rate or 10% de minimis of Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC).\n•  Indirect Cost Rate – An indirect cost rate agreement issued by the organization's cognizant federal agency. The \nvalid indirect cost rate agreement must be submitted with the application. If the agreement contains multiple rates \nindicate the rate that will be used in the comments/remarks section of the form.\n•  10% de minimis rate – Available for entities that do not have an indirect cost rate agreement.\nIndirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with \na particular cost objective. Such costs must be necessary for the general operation of the organization during VITA \nProgram activities.\nExamples of indirect costs may include:\n•  Depreciation or use allowance on buildings and equipment,\n•  The costs of operating and maintaining facilities, and\n•  General administration and expenses such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel adminis­\ntration, and accounting.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nAward Notification\b\n46\nOrganizations that do not have a negotiated indirect cost rate agreement may elect to charge a rate of 10% against its \nmodified total direct costs (MTDC) for indirect VITA Program expenses. MTDC includes all direct salaries and wages, \napplicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of \nthe period of performance of the sub-awards under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, rental \ncosts, and certain other costs. See 2 CFR 200.414(f) for more information.\nThe indirect cost rate will not increase or decrease the amount of the grant award and cannot be applied toward \nmatching funds expenses.\nFederal Funds as Match\nGenerally federal funds cannot be used as match for another federal grant; however, there are some exceptions. You \nmust confirm with the grantor of the funds and with the GPO before using these as matching funds. Examples 1 and \n2 show where federal funds could potentially be used as match. Example 3 is where federal funds cannot be used as \nmatch. Example 4 provides an example of where federal funds lose their identity as federal funds and are now available \nas use for match.\nExample 1: An Indian tribal government is awarded funds under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assis­\ntance Act (25 USC 5301) administered by the Department of the Interior. 25 USC 5322(c) states that with regard to \nIndian tribal grant funding, it can be used for matching purposes “for any other federal grant programs which contribute \nto the purposes for which … [Indian tribal grants] are made.” The DOI should be contacted to confirm that its use as a \nmatching fund for the VITA grant aligns with the purpose for which the Indian tribal grant is made.\nExample 2: A local government is awarded a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) (42 USC 5301 -5321) \nadministered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Section 5305(a)(9) states that funds may be \nused for the payment for the non-federal share required in connection with a federal grant-in-aid program undertaken \nas part of activities assisted under this chapter. HUD should be contacted to confirm that its use as a matching fund \nfor the VITA grant aligns with the purpose for which the CDBG is made. Contact with HUD confirmed the use of CDBG \nfunds as a match for the VITA Grant with limitation. If CDBG funds are used for the match, at a minimum 51% of the \ncustomers benefiting from the service (VITA) must meet the definition used by CDBG for “low-income.” The definition of \n“low-income” differs between HUD and the VITA Program.\nExample 3: Your organization utilizes AmeriCorps and VISTA volunteers, programs offered by the Corporation for \nNational and Community Services (CNS). Neither the volunteer’s time or any monies your organization provides as \ncost sharing for CNS can be used as match for the VITA Grant.\nExample 4: Your organization receives Legal Services Corporation grant funds. Grant funds received from the Legal \nServices Corporation are not considered federal funds and therefore can be used as a source of matching funds. \nHowever, they may only be used once for IRS grant matching purposes. The same funds may not be used as match for a \nLow Income Taxpayer Clinic grant and for a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance grant.\nThere are many examples of federal funds that can not be used as match. They include monies received from other IRS \ngrant programs (Low Income Taxpayer Clinic and Tax Counseling for the Elderly) as well as monies or services received for \nprograms sponsored by other federal agencies. Loan of IRS equipment or printers, IRS training or publicity materials, IRS \nprovided tax preparation software or services of IRS employees while performing their job may not be used as match.\nSimplified Method for Volunteer Return Preparation Recordkeeping\nThe simplified method for recordkeeping is an alternate method of determining matching funds for volunteer time. The \nrecipient replaces the volunteer timesheet used for matching funds with the simplified method. The organization will \nuse the number of federal returns prepared, tracked and accepted by IRS multiplied by the hourly wage for specific site \nrelated activities, i.e. tax preparer and screeners. \nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nAward Notification\b\n47\nThis method values these services by multiplying each federal return accepted at traditional VITA sites and reflected \non IRS reporting (ELF 1541 and SIDN Workbook reports) by the wage of a return preparer in the local labor market for \nthe preparation of a tax return. The total will then be accepted as the value of matching funds contributed toward the \nprogram by volunteer screeners and preparers. The simplified method can be used for all or a portion of the proposed \nmatch. Your organization may also continue to utilize time sheets for documenting the volunteer services match.\nOrganizations should use the following questions to determine if the simplified method will benefit your organization.\n1.  Do you propose to use volunteer services as part of your program’s matching requirement? If yes, continue to \nquestion 2. If no, the simplified method does not benefit your organization at this time.\n2.  Do you currently pay people by the hour to screen, prepare or quality review tax returns for your organization? \nIf yes, your organization is not eligible for the simplified method. You must continue to utilize time sheets \nand maintain records for three years after the end of grant reporting. If no, the simplified method may benefit \nyour organization by reducing your recordkeeping requirements around volunteer services as match. Please \nconsider the following information before making a decision to elect the simplified method.\n3.  Determine the hourly wage paid to return preparers in the local labor market for the preparation of a tax return. \nFocus on the hourly wage paid to persons who prepare tax returns for individuals but are not required to be \nor have the responsibilities of an accredited or certified public accountant. You may include an amount for a \nreasonable fringe benefit. You may substitute one hour’s wages and reasonable fringe benefits for each return \ncounted under this method using the existing measures for valuing volunteer services by the hour discussed \nabove under Valuing Volunteer and Paid Employee Time.\n4.  How many federal returns do your records show were accepted by IRS last year through traditional VITA? \nReturns are limited to those filed electronically and accepted at the sites operated based on the electronic \nfiling identification number (EFIN) or site identification number (SIDN) AND paper returns processed by IRS and \ncaptured on the SIDN Workbook Report. Though other returns can be counted toward your return production \ngoals, these are the only returns counted for purposes of the simplified method.\n5.  Multiply the number of federal returns in question 4 by the hourly wage determined in question 3. This is an \nestimate of the amount of matching funds you expect from the program this year. Compare it to your prior \nexperience in using time sheets to determine whether it meets your requirements for match. Use of the \nsimplified method is only an option. Your organization may continue to utilize time sheets for determining the \nvolunteer services match for screening, return preparation, and quality review.\nIf you are awarded a grant and use this simplified method, your grant documentation should include the research \ncompleted to determine the value you plan to use for each return and a report on the federal returns completed during \nthe grant year as support. This documentation may take many forms. For wage determination, it may be a note showing \nyou called three firms that prepare returns to find out what employees are paid or a copy of the research performed using \nan employment service or BLS information. For the number of federal returns, the documentation could be a report from \nthe software used; your local SPEC contact or your own internal records that distinguishes federal returns and whether \nthey were accepted. A line item should be captured in your ledger to record the match at the end of the program period \nand this same information reflected in the final budget included with the final report. During the filing season, you should \ncheck to make sure your organization is on target to achieve the anticipated match or make adjustments to identify other \ncontributions to meet program matching requirements.\nWe recognize volunteers also provide other services besides screening, return preparation and quality review for your \nprograms. However, due to the many varied ways in which programs are operated, we are unable to provide a simplified \nmethod of recordkeeping for all activities. Timesheets for other activities performed by volunteers are still required if \nutilized as matching funds for the grant. Supporting matching funds explanations should show the calculations that will \nbe used for those other activities.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nAward Notification\b\n48\nDocumentation Required for Matching Funds\nWe have modified the requirement around matching funds documentation. Organizations are not required to provide \nmatching funds documentation at time of application. Matching funds documentation will be due 20 days from the date \non the award notice. If you are selected as a grant recipient and all matching funds are not yet raised, your Payment \nManagement System (PMS) account is limited to the amount raised. Additional funds are made available once documen­\ntation is provided showing the remaining matching funds are available. \nAlert: If a contract or grant covers more than one year and is used as match for this application, the amount of funds \nremaining available to use as match should be addressed on your letterhead.\nExamples of Matching Funds\n#\nSource Name\nType\nAmount In-Hand\nor Committed\nAmount to \nbe Raised\nDate\nComments\n1\nApplicant \nOrganization\nCash\n$20,000\n7/1/\nXXXX\nFunds set aside\n2\nABC Foundation\nGrant\n$10,000\n6/30/\nXXXX\nLow-income assistance; \n8/1/XXXX - 7/31/XXXX\n3\nDEF Foundation\nDona­\ntion\n$9,800\n1/15/\nXXXX\nUse of computers, space, \nand office supplies both \nyears\n4\nApplicant \nOrganization\nDona­\ntion\n$22,500\n1/15/\nXXXX\nTax Preparers both years\nTotal\n$30,000\n$32,300\nSupporting Matching Funds Documentation\nDocumentation is required for funds inhand or committed that are used for the dollar-for-dollar match. If your organi­\nzation is awarded a grant, matching funds supporting documentation must be provided within 20 days after award notifi­\ncation is received. The sooner the information is provided, the sooner deposits into your PMS account will occur. There \nis no standard form for documentation. Common features of acceptable documentation include:\n•  A description of the contribution;\n•  A dollar value and an explanation as to how the valuation was determined, if applicable;\n•  A current date;\n•  A signature of an authorized individual who can make the commitment; and\n•  An organization name on letterhead with contact information.\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions\nAward Notification\b\n49\nFollowing are some examples of acceptable documentation descriptions. The values used in the examples may not \nrepresent true value. You must determine the value. The item numbers refer to the Examples of Matching Funds chart found \nin the previous section. We have provided an additional example of acceptable documentation in Appendix B, exhibit 2.\nItems 1 and 4 (Examples of Matching Funds chart): Final documentation to justify funding would be a signed \nstatement on applicant letterhead from the applicant organization that they have set aside $20,000 cash for a match for \nthe VITA grant to use during the period beginning October 1 through September 30.This same letter can also include the \nvolunteers they plan to secure and the calculation used for the estimated amount for volunteer services. It might look \nsomething like this: We will provide volunteers to prepare tax return preparation and quality review. We estimate we will \nhave 10 volunteers at $15 per hour averaging 10 hours per week each for 15 weeks for a total of $22,500. The $15 per \nhour is the average tax return preparation salary for Anywhere, ST, based on Department of Labor information.\nSeparate statements are not required from each volunteer that is participating. Timesheets showing the activities \nperformed and hours worked each day are required to support the matching funds for final reporting unless the simplified \nmethod is used to account for volunteer screening, preparation and quality review of federal returns.\nItem 2: Final documentation to justify funding would be a signed notice of grant award or other similar document from \nABC Foundation. It needs to include the time covered by the grant and the purpose for which the grant is awarded. This \ndescription should not preclude use in the VITA Program or be for activities that would eliminate its use in free tax return \npreparation.\nItem 3: Final documentation that would justify funding would be a signed statement on DEF Coalition letterhead \ndescribing the donation they will provide in support of VITA. For this example, the letter would include three sections \ndescribing the donation. DEF Coalition will provide in support of the VITA Program the following items and/or services: \n(1) Use of Computer Lab and computers for 15 weeks. This covers 15 computers at $10 each per week for the entire \nperiod (15 computers x $10 x15 weeks) for a total value of $2,250. The amount per week is the amount normally charged \nfor computer use for all sponsored programs. (2) Use of office space at three of our community centers to expand VITA \nsite operation to new locations for 15 weeks. Usage is estimated at three days each week at $50 per day for three sites \nfor 15 weeks for a total of $6,750. The amount per day is the amount normally charged for temporary use of office space \nat our facilities. The fee covers use of phone, copier, Internet and cleaning. (3) Donated supplies include eight used filing \ncabinets estimated at a fair market value of $25 each for a total of $200; 10 boxes paper at $35 each or $350 and $250 \nin miscellaneous other supplies (pens, pencils, shredders, staples, staplers, etc.).\nVITA Grant Program – Overview and Applications Instructions",
