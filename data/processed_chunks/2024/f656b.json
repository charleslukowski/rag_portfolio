The offer  \nprogram provides eligible taxpayers an opportunity to resolve their tax debt. The \nultimate goal is a compromise that suits the best interest of both the taxpayer and \nthe IRS. Generally, you must make an appropriate offer based on what the IRS \nconsiders your ability to pay.\nSubmitting an application does not ensure that the IRS will accept your offer. \nIt begins a process of evaluation and verification by the IRS, taking into \nconsideration any special circumstances that may affect your ability to pay.\nAre You Eligible?\nBefore your offer can be considered, you must (1) file all tax returns you are legally \nrequired to file, (2) have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on your \noffer, (3) make all required estimated tax payments for the current year, and (4)  if \nyou are a business owner with employees, make all required federal tax deposits \nfor the current quarter and the two preceding quarters.\nNote: If it is determined you have not filed all tax returns you are legally \nrequired to file, the IRS will apply any initial payment you sent with your offer \nto your tax debt and return both your offer and application fee to you. You \ncannot appeal this decision.\nBankruptcy, Open Audit, Innocent \nSpouse Claim, or Deactivated ITIN\nIf you or your business is currently in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you are not \neligible to apply for an offer. Any resolution of your outstanding tax debts generally \nmust take place within the context of your bankruptcy proceeding.\nResolve any open audit or outstanding innocent spouse claim issues before \nsubmitting an offer.\nWe will not consider an offer with a deactivated ITIN. If you have a deactivated \nITIN, please complete the Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer \nIdentification Number, and have it reactivated. Once the reactivation is completed, \nyou may submit an Offer in Compromise. \nCan You Pay in Full?\nGenerally, the IRS will not accept an offer if you can pay your tax debt in full \nthrough an installment agreement and/or equity in assets. \nNote: Adjustments or exclusions, which may be considered during the offer \ninvestigation, such as allowance of $1,000 to a bank balance or $3,450 against the \nvalue of a car, are only applied if you are an individual and after we determine you \ncannot full pay the liabilities from equity in assets, an installment agreement, or a \ncombination of both.\nYour Tax Refunds\nThe IRS may keep any tax period refund, including interest, for a tax return \nassessed before the date the IRS accepts your offer by offsetting it against your \ntax debt, as applicable. For example, you file your 2021 Form 1040 on April 15, \n2022; the IRS assesses the overpayment on May 26, 2022, triggering an offset; \nand the IRS accepts your offer on July 1, 2022. Because the IRS offset the \noverpayment prior to the acceptance of the offer, the overpayment will be used to \nreduce your outstanding tax liability. Since your tax refund may be offset to the tax \nliability while the offer is pending, assistance from Taxpayer Advocate or the IRS at \n800-829-1040 could be available for taxpayers (other than businesses) facing \neconomic hardship. The refund is not considered as a payment toward your \noffer. \nDoubt as to Liability\nIf you have a legitimate doubt that you owe part or all of the tax debt, complete and \nsubmit a Form 656-L, Offer in Compromise (Doubt as to Liability). To request a \nForm 656-L, visit IRS.gov or a local IRS office or call toll-free 800-TAX-FORM \n(800-829-3676).\nNote: Do not submit both an offer under Doubt as to Liability and an offer \nunder Doubt as to Collectibility or Effective Tax Administration at the same \ntime. You must resolve any doubt you owe part or all of the tax debt before \nsubmitting an offer based on your ability to pay.\n1\nNotice of Federal Tax Lien\nA lien is a legal claim against all your current and future property. When you don’t \npay your first bill for taxes due, a lien is created by law and attaches to your \nproperty. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) provides public notice to creditors. \nThe IRS files the NFTL to establish priority of the IRS claim versus the claims of \ncertain other creditors. The IRS may file a NFTL at any time. You may be entitled \nto file an appeal under the Collection Appeals Program (CAP) before this occurs or \nrequest a Collection Due Process hearing after this occurs. The IRS may be \nentitled to any proceeds from the sale of property subject to the lien(s). If you sell \nthe property prior to the release of the lien, excess property sale proceeds may be \napplied to your tax liability, even if your offer has been accepted.\nTrust Fund Taxes\nIf your business owes liabilities that include trust fund taxes, the IRS may hold \nresponsible individuals liable for the trust fund portion of the tax pursuant to \napplicable law. Trust fund taxes are the money withheld from an employee's \nwages, such as income tax, Social Security, and Medicare taxes. If the IRS \naccepts an offer from an employer for a portion of the trust fund tax liability, the \nremainder of the trust fund taxes may be collected from the responsible parties. \nYour business is not eligible for consideration of an offer unless you meet IRS \ncriteria, including the trust fund portion of the tax is paid, or the IRS has made the \nTrust Fund Recovery Penalty determination(s) on all potentially responsible \nindividual(s). However, if you are submitting the offer as a victim of payroll service \nprovider fraud or failure, the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty assessment discussed \nabove is not required prior to submitting the offer. \nOther Important Facts\nYou have the right to appeal an offer rejection, but not the return of an offer.\nPenalties and interest will continue to accrue while your offer is considered by the \nIRS. \nAfter you submit your offer, you must continue to timely file and pay all required tax \nreturns, estimated tax payments, and federal tax payments for yourself and any \nbusiness in which you have an interest. Failure to meet your filing and payment \nresponsibilities during consideration of your offer will result in the IRS \nreturning your offer. If the IRS accepts your offer, you must continue to stay \ncurrent with all tax filing and payment obligations through the fifth year after your \noffer is accepted.\nNote: If you have filed your tax returns but you have not received a bill for at least \none tax debt included on your offer, your offer and application fee may be returned \nand any initial payment sent with your offer will be applied to your tax debt. To \nprevent the return of your offer, wait until you have received a bill for at least \none tax debt and then include a copy of any tax return filed within 10 weeks \nof this offer submission.\nWe can't process your offer if the IRS referred your case involving all tax periods to \nthe Department of Justice. In addition, we cannot compromise any tax liability \narising from a restitution amount ordered by a court or a tax debt reduced to \njudgment. Furthermore, we will not compromise any IRC § 965 tax liability for \nwhich an election was made under IRC § 965(i). You cannot appeal this decision.\nThe law requires the IRS to make certain information from accepted offers  \navailable for public inspection and review. Find instructions to request a public \ninspection file at IRS.gov key words \"public inspection file.\"\nThe IRS may levy your assets up to the time the IRS official signs and \nacknowledges your offer as pending. In addition, the IRS may keep any proceeds \nreceived from the levy. If your assets are levied after your offer is submitted and \nunder consideration, immediately contact the IRS at the phone number listed on \nthe levy. \nIf you currently have an approved installment agreement, you will not be required \nto make your installment agreement payments while we consider your offer. If your \noffer is not accepted and you have not incurred any additional tax debt, the IRS will \nreinstate your installment agreement.\n2\nPAYING FOR YOUR OFFER\nApplication Fee\nOffers require a $205 application fee.  \nException: If you are an individual and meet the Low-Income Certification \nguidelines, there is no requirement to submit any offer payments or the \napplication fee upon submission or during the consideration of your offer. \nYou are considered an individual if you are seeking compromise of a liability for \nwhich you are personally responsible, including any liability you incurred as a sole \nproprietor. \nPayment Options\nYou must select a payment option and include the initial payment with your offer. \nThe amount of the initial payment and subsequent payments will depend on the \ntotal amount of your offer and which of the following payment options you choose: \nLump Sum: This option requires 20% of the total offer amount to be paid  with the \noffer and the remaining balance paid in 5 or fewer payments within 5 or  fewer \nmonths of the date your offer is accepted.  \nPeriodic Payment: This option requires you to make the first payment with the \noffer and the remaining balance paid in monthly payments within 6 to 24 months, \nin accordance with your proposed offer terms.  \nNote: Under the periodic payment option, you must continue to make \nmonthly payments while the IRS is evaluating your offer. If you fail to make \nthese payments at any time prior to receiving a final decision letter, the IRS may \nreturn your offer. You cannot appeal this decision. Total payments must equal the \ntotal offer amount. Generally, payments made on an offer will not be returned. \nThe initial payment and monthly payments are not required if you meet the Low-\nIncome Certification guidelines. If you qualified under the Low-Income Certification \nand are not required to submit payments while the offer is under consideration, \nyour first payment will be due 30 calendar days after acceptance of the offer, \nunless another date is agreed to in an amended offer.   \nIf you do not have sufficient cash to pay for your offer, you may need to consider  \nborrowing money from a bank, friends, and/or family. Other options may include  \nborrowing against or selling other assets.  \nIf you are an individual, use the OIC Pre-Qualifier tool at IRS.gov/OICtool to \nassist in determining a starting point for your offer amount. You may also \nuse the OIC eligibility check on Individual Online Account (IOLA). \nNote: You may not pay your offer amount with an expected or current tax \nrefund, money already paid, funds attached by any collection action, or \nanticipated benefits from a capital or net operating loss. If you are planning to \nuse your retirement savings from an IRA or 401k  plan, you may have future tax \ndebt as a result. Contact the IRS or your tax advisor before taking this action.\n3\nHOW TO APPLY\nApplication Process\nThe application must include:\n•   Form 656, Offer in Compromise\n•   Completed and signed Form 433-A (OIC), Collection Information Statement for \nWage Earners and Self-Employed Individuals, if applicable \n•   Completed and signed Form 433-B (OIC), Collection Information Statement for \nBusinesses, if applicable \n•   $205 application fee, unless you meet Low-Income Certification Guidelines\n•   Initial offer payment based on the payment option you choose, unless you \nmeet Low-Income Certification Guidelines\nNote: Your offer(s) cannot be considered without the completed and signed \nForm(s) 656, 433-A (OIC), 433-B (OIC) (if applicable), and supporting \ndocumentation.\nIf You and Your Spouse Owe  \nJoint and Separate Tax Debts\nIf you and your spouse have joint tax debt(s) and you or your spouse are also \nresponsible for separate tax debt(s) (including Trust Fund Recovery Penalty), \nyou will each need to send in a separate Form 656. You will complete one Form \n656 for yourself listing all your joint and any separate tax debt(s) and your \nspouse will complete one Form 656 listing all their joint and any separate tax \ndebt(s), for a total of two Forms 656. \nIf you and your spouse or ex-spouse have a joint tax debt and your spouse or ex- \nspouse does not want to be part of the offer, you may submit a Form 656 to \ncompromise your responsibility for the joint tax debt. \nEach Form 656 will require the $205 application fee and initial payment \nunless you are an individual and meet the Low-Income Certification \nguidelines. \nIf You Owe Individual and  \nBusiness Tax Debt\nIf you have individual and business tax debt that you wish to compromise, you will  \nneed to send in two Forms 656. Complete one Form 656 for your individual tax  \ndebt(s) and one Form 656 for your business tax debt(s). Each Form 656 will \nrequire  the $205 application fee and initial payment. \nNote: A business is defined as a corporation, partnership, or any business  that is \noperated as other than a sole-proprietorship. You may not compromise an \nindividual's share of a partnership debt. The partnership must submit its own offer \nbased on the partnership's and partners' ability to pay.\n4\nCOMPLETING THE APPLICATION PACKAGE\nTo calculate an offer amount, you will need to gather information about your  \nfinancial situation, including cash, investments, available credit, assets, income,  \nand debt.   \nYou will also need to gather information about your household's average gross \nmonthly income and expenses. The household includes all those in addition to \nyourself who contribute money to pay expenses relating to the household such as: \nrent, utilities, insurance, groceries, etc. This is necessary for the IRS to accurately \nevaluate your offer. The IRS may also use this to determine your share of the total \nhousehold income and expenses. \nIn general, the IRS will not consider expenses for tuition for private schools,  \ncollege expenses, charitable contributions, and other unsecured debt payments as \npart of the expense calculation. \nStep 1 – Gather Your Information\nStep 2 – Fill out Form 433-A   \n(OIC), Collection Information  \nStatement for Wage Earners and  \nSelf-Employed Individuals \nFill out Form 433-A (OIC) if you are an individual wage earner, operate or operated \nas a sole proprietor, or are authorized to submit an offer on behalf of the estate of \na deceased individual. This will assist in the calculation of an appropriate offer \namount based on your assets, income, expenses, and future earning potential. If \nyou are married but living separately from your spouse then you each must submit \na Form 433-A (OIC). If the IRS requests information that is not provided by a \nspouse, then the IRS may choose to return the offer. \nStep 3 – Fill out Form 433-B (OIC),  \nCollection Information Statement   \nfor Businesses\nFill out Form 433-B (OIC) if the business is a Corporation, Partnership, or LLC. \nThis will assist in the calculation of an appropriate offer  amount based on the \nbusiness assets, income, expenses, and future earning  potential. If the business \nhas assets used to produce income (for example, a tow truck used in the business \nfor towing vehicles), the IRS may allow the business to exclude equity in these \nassets. \nStep 4 – Attach Required  \nDocumentation\nYou will need to attach supporting documentation with Form(s) 433-A (OIC) and  \n433-B (OIC). See a list of the documents required at the end of each  form. Include \ncopies of all required attachments. Do not send original documents. \nStep 5 – Fill out Form 656, Offer   \nin Compromise\nFill out Form 656. The Form 656 identifies the tax years and type of tax you would  \nlike to compromise. It also identifies your offer amount and the payment terms. \nYour offer amount must be equal to or greater than the amount calculated in Form \n433-A(OIC) or 433-B(OIC).  \nStep 6 – Include Initial Payment  \nand $205 Application Fee \nInclude a personal check, cashier's check, or money order for your initial payment  \nbased on the payment option you selected (20% of the offer amount for a lump \nsum offer or the first month's payment for a periodic payment offer). Generally, \ninitial payments will not be returned but will be applied to your tax debt if your offer \nis not accepted.  \nIf you choose to pay the fee and offer payment by personal check, cashier’s \ncheck, or money order, provide a separate personal check, cashier’s check, \nor money order for each fee and offer payment you submit. Make checks or \nmoney orders in U.S. dollars and payable to the \"United States Treasury.\" As \nan alternative to checks or money orders, you may pay the fee and offer payment \nelectronically through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System. Individual \ntaxpayers may also pay the fee and offer payment via Individual Online Account. \nReminder: If you meet the Low-Income Certification guidelines DO NOT send \nany money.\nStep 7 – Send the Application   \nPackage \nMake a copy of your application package and keep it for your records.   \nSend the completed application package to the appropriate IRS facility. See page \n29, Application Checklist, for details. If you are an individual taxpayer, you may \nalso file your OIC via Individual Online Account (IOLA).  \nNote: If you are working with an IRS employee, let them know you are  \nsending or have sent an offer to compromise your tax debt(s).  \n5\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\nAfter You Send Your Application:\nWe will contact you after we receive and review your offer application. Promptly \nreply to any requests for additional information within the time frame specified. \nFailure to reply timely will result in the return of your offer without appeal rights. \nIf we accept your offer, you must continue to timely file all required tax returns and \ntimely pay all estimated tax payments and federal tax payments that become due \nin the future. If you fail to timely file and timely pay any tax obligations that become \ndue within the five years after your offer acceptance we may default your offer. If \nwe default your offer, you will be liable for the original tax debt, less payments \nmade, and all accrued interest and penalties. An offer does not stop the accrual of \ninterest and penalties. Please note that if your final payment is more than the \nagreed amount, we will not return the money but will apply it to your tax debt.  \nIn addition, we may default your offer if you fail to promptly pay any tax debts \nassessed after acceptance of your offer for any tax years prior to acceptance that \nwere not included in your original offer.\n6\nCatalog Number 55896Q\nwww.irs.gov\nForm 433-A (OIC) (Rev. 4-2025) \nForm 433-A (OIC) \n(April 2025) \nDepartment of the Treasury — Internal Revenue Service \nCollection Information Statement for Wage Earners and  \nSelf-Employed Individuals \nUse this form if you are \n●   An individual who owes income tax on a Form 1040, U.S.  \nIndividual Income Tax Return \n●   An individual with a personal liability for Excise Tax \n●   An individual responsible for a Trust Fund Recovery Penalty \n●   An individual who is self-employed or has self-employment  \nincome.

I authorize the IRS to amend Section 1 or Section 2 if I failed to list any of my assessed \ntax debt or tax debt assessed before acceptance of my offer. By submitting a joint offer, both signers grant \napproval to the Internal Revenue Service to disclose the existence of any separate liabilities owed.\nb) I also authorize the IRS to amend Section 1 or Section 2 by removing any tax years on which there is currently \nno outstanding liability. I understand that my offer will be accepted, by law, unless the IRS notifies me otherwise, \nin writing, within 24 months of the date my offer was received by our IRS centralized offer in compromise unit, \nlocated in  Memphis/Brookhaven. See mailing instructions on page 29 of Form 656-B for offers that are mailed. \nIndividual taxpayers may file offers through Individual Online Account (IOLA). The 24-month period for a deemed \nacceptance will not begin to run until the correct site receives the offer. I also understand that if any tax debt that \nis included in the offer is in dispute in any judicial proceeding that tax debt will not be included in determining the \nexpiration of the 24-month period. I instruct the IRS to disregard any period on my Form 656 for court ordered \nrestitution or under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice.\nCatalog Number 16728N\nwww.irs.gov\nForm 656 (Rev. 4-2025) \nPage 5",

    "text": "Section 7 (Continued)\nOffer Terms \nc) I voluntarily submit the payments made on this offer and understand that they will not be returned even if I \nwithdraw the offer or the IRS rejects or returns the offer. Unless I designate how to apply each required payment \nin Section 5, the IRS will apply my payment in the best interest of the government, choosing which tax years and \ntax debts to pay off. The IRS will also keep my application fee unless the offer is not accepted for processing. \nIRS will keep my payments, \nfees, and some refunds. \nd) I understand that if I checked the Low-Income Certification in Section 1, then no payments are required. If I \nqualify for the Low-Income Certification and voluntarily submit payments, all money will be applied to my tax debt \nand will not be returned to me.\ne) Treas. Reg. section 301.7122(e)(5) states, in part, that acceptance of an offer in compromise will conclusively \nsettle the liability for the tax periods specified in the offer. To enforce the regulation as a contract term, I agree \nthat I cannot file an amended return for the tax years listed on Form 656 after the offer is accepted. Further, I \nagree that I will not file an amended return for the tax years listed on Form 656 after I have submitted my offer \nand while my offer remains pending [see section 7(j) below] with the Service. The filing of the amended return \ncould be considered grounds for termination. In addition, any refunds related to an amended return filed for a tax \nyear which has an ending date prior to offer acceptance will be offset to the tax liability. If I receive a refund prior \nto offer acceptance, or based on an amended return for any tax periods extending to the date my offer is \naccepted, I will return the refund within 30 days of receiving the refund. The IRS will keep any refund, including \ninterest, that I might be due for tax assessed before the date the IRS accepts my offer. Systemic offset of \noverpayments will continue in accordance with IRC 6402(a) prior to the offer acceptance date. I understand that \nmy tax refund may be offset to the tax liability while the offer is pending, but that assistance could be available for \ntaxpayers (other than businesses) facing an economic hardship.\nf) I understand that the amount I am offering may not include part or all of an expected or current tax refund, \nmoney already paid, funds attached by any collection action, or anticipated benefits from a capital or net operating \nloss.\ng) The IRS will keep any monies it has collected prior to this offer. Under section 6331(k), the IRS may levy on my \nproperty and rights to property up to the time that the IRS official signs and acknowledges my offer as pending. \nThe IRS may keep any proceeds arising from such a levy. No levy will be issued on individual shared \nresponsibility payments. However, if the IRS served a continuous levy on wages, salary, or certain federal \npayments under sections 6331(e) or (h), then the IRS could choose to either retain or release the levy.\nh) The IRS will keep any payments that I make related to this offer. I agree that any funds submitted with this offer \nwill be treated as a payment. I also agree that any funds submitted with periodic payments made after the \nsubmission of this offer and prior to the acceptance, rejection, or return of this offer will be treated as payments.\ni) If my offer is accepted and my final payment is more than the agreed amount, the IRS will not return the \ndifference, but will apply the entire payment to my tax debt. \nj) Once an authorized IRS official signs this form, my offer is considered pending as of that signature date and it \nremains pending until the IRS accepts, rejects, or returns my offer, or I withdraw my offer. An offer is also \nconsidered pending for 30 days after any rejection of my offer by the IRS, and during the time that any rejection of \nmy offer is being considered by the Appeals Office. An offer will be considered withdrawn when the IRS receives \nmy written notification of withdrawal by personal delivery or certified mail or when I inform the IRS of my \nwithdrawal by other means and the IRS acknowledges in writing my intent to withdraw the offer. For joint offers in \ncompromise, if one spouse withdraws the offer, the offer will be considered to be withdrawn.\nPending status of an offer and \nright to appeal \nk) I waive the right to an Appeals hearing if I do not request a hearing in writing within 30 days of the date the IRS \nnotifies me of the decision to reject the offer.\nl) As both an express condition and as a contractual promise, I will strictly comply with all provisions of the internal \nrevenue laws, including requirements to timely file tax returns and timely pay taxes for the five year period \nbeginning with the date of acceptance of this offer and ending through the fifth year. I agree to promptly pay any \nliabilities assessed after acceptance of this offer for tax years ending prior to acceptance of this offer that were not \notherwise identified in Section 1 or Section 2 of this agreement. I also understand that during the five year period I \ncannot request an installment agreement for unpaid taxes incurred before or after the accepted offer. I understand \nthat I cannot request an offer for a tax liability during the five year period. If this is an offer being submitted for joint \ntax debt, and one of us does not comply with future obligations, only the non-compliant taxpayer will be in default \nof this agreement. An accepted offer will not be defaulted solely due to the assessment of an individual shared \nresponsibility payment. I understand failure to pay any restitution-based assessments will provide basis for the \ndefault of my offer acceptance for administrative tax periods included on this Form 656.\nI must comply with my future \ntax obligations and understand \nI remain liable for the full \namount of my tax debt until all \nterms and conditions of this \noffer have  been met. \nm) I agree that I will remain liable for the full amount of the tax liability, accrued penalties and interest, until I have \nmet all of the terms and conditions of this offer. Penalties and interest will continue to accrue until all payment \nterms of the offer have been met. If I file for bankruptcy before the terms and conditions of the offer are met, I \nagree that the IRS may file a claim for the full amount of the tax liability, accrued penalties and interest, and that \nany claim the IRS files in the bankruptcy proceeding will be a tax claim.\nn) Once the IRS accepts my offer in writing, I have no right to challenge the tax debt(s) in court or by filing a \nrefund claim or refund suit for any liability or period listed in Section 1 or Section 2, even if the IRS defaults or \nrescinds the offer.\nCatalog Number 16728N\nwww.irs.gov\nForm 656 (Rev. 4-2025) \nPage 6",

If the IRS terminates my offer contract, I will be liable for the full amount of the \ntax liability, accrued penalties and interest.\nI understand what will happen if \nI fail to meet the terms of my \noffer (e.g., default). \np) To have my offer considered, I agree to the extension of the time limit provided by law to assess my tax debt \n(statutory period of assessment). I agree that the date by which the IRS must assess my tax debt will now be the \ndate by which my debt must currently be assessed plus the period of time my offer is pending plus one additional \nyear if the IRS rejects, returns, or terminates my offer or I withdraw it. (Paragraph (j) of this section defines \npending and withdrawal.) I understand that I have the right not to waive the statutory period of assessment or to \nlimit the waiver to a certain length or certain periods or issues. I understand, however, that the IRS may not \nconsider my offer if I refuse to waive the statutory period of assessment or if I provide only a limited waiver. I also \nunderstand that the statutory period for collecting my tax debt will be suspended during the time my offer is \npending with the IRS, for 30 days after any rejection of my offer by the IRS, and during the time that any rejection \nof my offer is being considered by the Independent Office of Appeals. By submitting this offer I immediately \nwithdraw any pending installment agreement that is on file for all tax periods and I understand a pending \ninstallment agreement (an installment agreement that has been accepted for processing but the IRS has not \naccepted its terms) will not be automatically reinstated after the offer is closed.\nI agree to waive time limits \nprovided by law. \nq) The IRS may file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien during consideration of the offer or for offers that will be paid \nover time. If the offer is accepted, the tax lien(s) for the periods and taxes listed in Section 1 will generally be \nreleased within 45 days after the final payment has been received and verified. The time it takes to transfer funds \nto the IRS from commercial institutions varies based on the form of payment. If I have not finished paying my offer \namount, then the IRS may be entitled to any proceeds from the sale of my property. The IRS will not file a Notice \nof Federal Tax Lien on any individual shared responsibility debt.\nI understand the IRS may file a \nNotice of Federal Tax Lien on \nmy property. \nr) I authorize the IRS to correct any typographical or clerical errors or make minor modifications to my Form 656 \nthat I signed in connection to this offer.\nCorrection Agreement \ns) By authorizing the IRS to contact third parties, I understand that I will not be notified of which third parties the \nIRS contacts as part of the offer application process, including tax periods that have not been assessed, as stated \nin  §7602 (c ) of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, I authorize the IRS to request a consumer report on me \nfrom a credit bureau. \nI authorize the IRS to contact  \nrelevant third parties in order to \nprocess my offer. \nt) I understand if the liability sought to be compromised is the joint and individual liability of myself and my co-\nobligor(s) and I am submitting this offer to compromise my individual liability only, then if this offer is accepted, it \ndoes not release or discharge my co-obligor(s) from liability. The United States still reserves all rights of collection \nagainst the co-obligor(s).\nI am submitting an offer as an \nindividual for a joint liability.\nu) If your offer includes any shared responsibility payment (SRP) amount that you owe for not having minimum \nessential health coverage for you and, if applicable, your dependents per Internal Revenue Code Section 5000A  \n- Individual shared responsibility payment, it is not subject to penalties (except applicable bad check penalty) or to \nlien and levy enforcement actions. However, interest will continue to accrue until you pay the total SRP balance \ndue. We may apply your federal tax refunds to the SRP amount that you owe until it is paid in full. \nI understand the IRS Shared \nResponsibility Payment (SRP).\nv) The IRS is required to make certain information, such as taxpayer name, city/state/zip, liability amount, and \noffer terms, available for public inspection and review for one year after the date of offer acceptance.\nI understand the IRS is required \nto make certain information \npublic.\nw) By sending and receiving encrypted messages through the IRS Secure Messaging platform, I agree to accept \noffer final determination letters on this platform.\nSecure Messaging\nx) If I submit a joint offer in compromise, it will remain joint unless both my spouse and I submit amended \nForms 656.\nI understand that my joint offer \nin compromise will remain joint.\nCatalog Number 16728N\nwww.irs.gov\nForm 656 (Rev. 4-2025) \nPage 7",
